["Karnataka Textbook Society(R.) No.4,100 Feet Ring Road, Banashankari 3rd Stage, Bangalore - 85 Government of Karnataka SOCIAL SCIENCE Part - 1 (Revised - 2022) 10 Standard ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished ii PREFACE The Textbook Society, Karnataka has been engaged in producing new textbooks according to the new syllabi which in turn are designed on NCF – 2005 since June 2010. Textbooks are prepared in 12 languages; seven of them serve as the media of instruction. From standard 1 to 4 there is the EVS, mathematics and 5th to 10th there are three core subjects namely mathematics, science and social science. NCF – 2005 has a number of special features and they are: • connecting knowledge to life activities • learning to shift from rote methods • enriching the curriculum beyond textbooks • learning experiences for the construction of knowledge • making examinations flexible and integrating them with classroom experiences • caring concerns within the democratic policy of the country • making education relevant to the present and future needs. • softening the subject boundaries- integrated knowledge and the joy of learning. • the child is the constructor of knowledge The new books are produced based on three fundamental approaches namely. Constructive approach, Spiral Approach and Integrated approach The learner is encouraged to think, engage in activities, master skills and competencies. The materials presented in these books are integrated with values. The new books are not examination oriented in their nature. On the other hand they help the learner in the all round development of his/her personality, thus help him/ her become a healthy member of a healthy society and a productive citizen of this great country, India. In Social science especially in standard 5 the first chapter deals with the historical, geographical, cultural and local study of the division in which learners live. Chapters on sociology, business studies and commerce are introduc", "ed in standard VIII as per the guidelines of NCF-2005. A lot of additional information is given through box items. Learners are encouraged to work towards construction of knowledge through assignments and projects. Learning load of memorizing dates has been reduced to the minimum. Life values have been integrated with content of each chapter. The Textbook Society expresses grateful thanks to the chairpersons, writers, scrutinisers, artists, staff of DIETs and CTEs and the members of the Editorial Board and printers in helping the Text Book Society in producing these textbooks. Prof. G. S. Mudambadithaya Coordinator, Curriculum Revision and Textbook Preparation Karnataka Textbook Society Bengaluru, Karnataka Nagendra Kumar Managing Director Karnataka Textbook SocietyÀ Bengaluru, Karnataka ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished iii Chairpersons’ Note A demand for the change of curriculum, syllabi and textbooks has been heard from parents at an internal of five years. The Government of Karnataka has accepted the demand favourably and revised its Curriculum (KCF 2007) and syllabi in all subjects. As a result of it textbooks are being prepared in various subjects and the result is this Social Science book for standard X. It has been designed and prepared according to the changed situations in various curricular areas to enable the students to construct knowledge through activities. There are six subject areas namely, History, Political Science, Geography, Economics, Sociology and Business Studies. The textbook has been prepared keeping in mind the changing situations in rural and urban scenario and at the same time providing opportunities for creativity among learners. A large number of activities and project works have been designed for the purpose. These are designed based on the fact that we live in a world of competition where acquiring knowledge has become the need of the day. The matter has been presented in a simple style and all technical words u", "sed have been glossed. That does not mean that we have succeeded fully in our endeavour, though we have followed the basic principles enunciated in NCF 2005. We express our grateful thanks to all those who gave us concrete suggestions at every stage of preparation of the book. We are grateful to the writers, the scrutiny committee members and translators. We are especially grateful to the chief coordinator Prof. G S Mudambadithaya who has been striving hard in planning and bringing out textbooks of very high standard in all subjects. We express our sincere thanks to the Managing Director, Deputy Director and the coordinator of Social Science book. I also place on record my indebtedness to the Vice Chancellor, Registrar and other colleagues of the University of Tumakuru for their encouragement and guidance. Dr. M. Shashidhar Dr. P.

Text Book Committee ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished v About the Revision of Textbooks Honourable Chief Minister Sri Siddaramaiah who is also the Finance Minister of Karnataka, in his response to the public opinion about the new", " textbooks from standard I to X, announced, in his 2014-15 budget speech of constituting an expert-committee, to look into the matter. He also spoke of the basic expectations therein, which the textbook experts should follow: “ The textbooks should aim at inculcating social equality, moral values, development of personality, scientific temper, critical acumen, secularism and the sense of national commitment”, he said. Later, for the revision of the textbooks from class I to X, the Department of Education constituted twenty seven committees and passed an order on 24-11-2014. The committees so constituted were subject and class-wise and were in accordance with the standards prescribed. Teachers who are experts in matters of subjects and syllabi were in the committees. There were already many complaints, and analyses about the textbooks. So, a freehand was given in the order dated 24-11-2014 to the responsible committees to examine and review to text and even to prepare new text and revise if necessary. Eventually, a new order was passed on 19-9-2015 which also gave freedom even to re- write the textbooks if necessary. In the same order, it was said that the completely revised textbooks could be put to force from 2017-18 instead of 2016-17. Many self inspired individuals and institutions, listing out the wrong information and mistakes that were in the texts, had sent them to the Education Minister and to the Textbook Society. They were rectified. Before rectification we had exchanged ideas by arranging debates. Discussions had taken place with Primary and Secondary Education Teachers’ Associations. Questionnaires were administered among teachers to pool up opinions. Separate meetings were held with teachers, subject inspectors and DIET Principals. Analytical opinions had been collected. To the subject experts of science, social science, mathematics and languages, textbooks were sent in advance and later meetings were held for discussions. Women associations and science", "-related organistations were also invited for discussions. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished vi Thus, on the basis of all the inputs received from various sources, the textbooks have been revised whereever necessary. Another very important aspect has to be shared here. We constituted three expert committees. They were constituted to make suggestions after making a comparative study of the texts of science, mathematics and social science subjects of central schools (NCERT), along with the state textbooks. Thus, the state textbooks have been enriched based on the comparative analysis and suggestions made by the experts. The state textbooks have been guarded not to go lower in standards than the textbooks of central schools. Besides, these textbooks have been examined along side with the textbooks of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra states. Another clarification has to be given here. Whatever we have done in the committees is only revision, it is not the total preparation of the textbooks. Therefore, the structures of the already prepared textbooks have in no way been affected or distorted. They have only been revised in the background of gender equality, regional representation, national integrity, equality and social harmony. While doing so, the curriculum frames of both central and state have not been transgressed. Besides, the aspirations of the constitution are incorporated carefully. Further, the reviews of the committees were once given to higher expert committees for examination and their opinions have been inculcated into the textbooks. Finally, we express our grateful thanks to those who strived in all those 27 committees with complete dedication and also to those who served in higher committees and experts of revised textbooks also. At the same time, we thank all the supervising officers of the Textbook Society who sincerely worked hard in forming the committees and managed to see the task reach its logical completion.", " We thank all the members of the staff who co-operated in this venture. Our thanks are also due to the subject experts and to the associations who gave valuable suggestions. M.P. Madegowda Managing Director Karnataka Textbook Society (R) Bengaluru.

The revised textbooks reached the students only in 2017-18 school year. The changes made in revised textbooks came under wide scrutiny and criticism. Since there was an all-round objection that such a textbook revision was done with an objective of propagation of a certain ideology that benefitted self-interests, side-lining education’s core intention, the honourable Karnataka Government in 2021 formed a committee mandat­ ing to re-review such textbooks. The committee has reviewed in depth, such textbooks which had attracted objections, and has recommended certain changes. Today’s children are tomorrow’s nation, they say. The future of our society depends on what we teach the children of today in schools. The text­ books that students study must have healthy thoughts and concepts. It must not be spreading mutual distrust, hatred, neglect amongst the different class and communities of the society; should incite nationalism and patriotism. The textbooks should provide objective information about the past events of state and nation. They must introduce local culture, language and traditions to the students. Overall, the textbooks must make the students fine, responsible, conscious, open minded and honourable citizens. The textbook revision had to be made by bearing this responsibility in mind. We had to build a framework for ourselves for reviewing and revising the textbooks. Primarily, our intention was to ensure that the social science textbook (1) contained no content that was disre", "spectful towards any caste, reli­ gion, philosophy, community or individual (2) subjects to be presented in a systematic, chronological order (3) had to be made knowledge-bank instead of an information dump of unnecessary matters (4) had to be made bereft of any self-interest ideology (5) had to be devoid of half-truths, falsehoods, exaggerations, judgemental information and instead must present facts which have authoritative basis (6) had to contain all subjects with deserving representation Foreword On review of text books ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished ix (7) had to include historically neglected facts, based on their importance (8) had to be corrected for the errors, as far as possible. At every stage of revision, we were cautious that social science textbooks have to make our students conscientious citizens who will have love, pride about our nation, not create a community that has negligence and repulsion for a few castes, communities, languages and religions of this nation. The ‘best textbook’ is an ideal state. Our intention is to walk towards such an ideal state. However, to create such a thing in exact sense is not possible. With this humbleness, we have completed re-reviewing the textbooks and present you the revised version. This is only a review, not a comprehensive recreation. The intent and form of the already created textbooks (2014) remain intact. The entire revision has happened following the state syllabus framework which itself is based on the national curriculum framework. In addition, the intent of the Constitution has been upheld. I am grateful to all my colleagues of the review committee who have finished this job in the best possible way. Also, thankful to all the officers and staff of the textbook association who co­ operated in the smooth conducting of the committee’s functions. This revision, we believe, will reflect the intent of the new National Education Policy and also become the starting point for the compreh", "ensive revision of textbooks to come. M.P.

There was great demand for Indian pepper, cumin, cinnamen, cardamom, ginger and many other spices in Europe. The trade relations between India, Europe and other Asian countries continued even during the Middle Ages. The Arab merchants carried Asian merchandise to Constantinople of Eastern Roman (Byzantium) Empire. The Italian merchants would buy these goods and then sell them in European countries. Constantinople was thus the center of international trade and was considered as the ‘Gateway of European Trade’. While Arab merchants had gained monopoly over the trade in Asian countries, Italian traders had gained monopoly over trade in Europe. The merchandise from Asia brought good profits to Italian merchants. The fall of Constantinople: The trade and commerce between Asia and Europe was carried on place through the city of Constantinople. In 1453, the Ottoman Turks captured the city of Constantinople. As a result, all the trade routes connecting the city of Constantinople came under the control of Turks. The Turks started levying too many taxes on the goods passing through these routes. As a result, trade became unprofitable. Meanwhile, Spain, Portugal and other European rulers were attempting to break the monopoly of Italian traders. They started encouraging enterprising sailors to find a new sea route to India. T", "he invention of compass, astrolabes, and gunpowder provided further impetus to this venture. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 2 A new sea route to India: Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese sailor left Lisbon and reached Kappadu near Calicut on the West coast of India in 1498. Thus he was successful in discovering a new sea route to India. This route continued to be the route of trade between India and Europe for many years. the Portuguese were thus the first to re-establish trade between India and Europe. Do you know this? In 1869, a huge canal called Suez Canal. was built in Egypt to connect the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Until the building of Suez Canal, the sea route discovered by Vasco da Gama was the route used for trade between India and Europe. The ships had to pass the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost tip of Africa, to reach India. European Trade Companies: With the success of the Portuguese, the Dutch, French and the English arrived in India for trade. This development not only changed the history of India, it also changed the history of European countries. The Portuguese: The Portuguese were the first to arrive in India for trade and were also the last to leave India by the sea route. After Vasco da Gama, Francisco de Almeida arrived in India as the Viceroy of the Portuguese. He implemented ‘Blue Water Policy’ in order to establish the supremacy over the sea instead of supremacy over land. Alfonso de Albuquerque, who came after Almeida, is considered as the real founder of Portuguese Empire in India. He waged a battle against the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 and won Goa. Goa became the administrative centre of the Portuguese administration in India. The Portuguese had absolute monopoly over trade with India for a century but their power declined with the arrival of English and French in India. The rise and decline of the Dutch in India : In 1602 the Dutch East India Company came to India and established trading centers at Surat, Bro", "ach, Kambe, Kochin, Nagapatnam, Masulipatnam and Chinsore. In the politics of Kerala the one who lived in the most important phase and rescued an important principality from the foreigners was Raja Marthanda Varma of Wynad. He ruled from 1729 to 1758 and saved from the surrounding rulers as well as foreigners. He made this as a great Kingdom among all. He stood against the foreigners ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 3 who were greedy of pepper and brought many reforms in administration. He shifted his capital from Padmanabhapura to Thiruvananthapura and made his Kingdom as 'world Travancore province'. There were confusions and chaos in this kingdom before Marthanda Varma came to throne. Earlier ruler Rama Varma was very weak. The Dutch East India company possessed strong military power and had greater ambition in the politics. The surrounding rulers were also strong. The poleygars of Wynad made ruler Rama Varma weak. Even at a tender age of 10, Marthanda Varma suggested strategies to his maternal uncle Rama Varma for the raise of his province. As per that Rama Varma Contacted Pandyas of Madurai. This made the Poleygars to keep quite. This is how Marthanda Varma came to prominence at a young age only. After Rama varma at the age of 24 years Marthanda Varma came to the throne. He Compiled an army of 50,000 Soldiers to extend the border of wynad. He occupied the pepper growing areas. By this time the Dutch who were trying to monopolise was defeated by Marthanda Varma. He controlled the surrounding areas and made them to oppose the Dutch. The Dutch with help of the provinces like Kayamkulam, Kochi, Purakkad and Vadakunkur attacked on travancore, Raja Marthanda defeated them and captured Nedumangala and Kottarakara trading centres. He also wrote a strong letter to the Dutch that he would never give up the trade rights of pepper to any foreigners. In 1741 the Dutch declared war on Travancore with Kottarakara province in the forefront. Some of the lo", "cal provinces also joined the Dutch. But Marthanda Varma's army strongly sent it back. The Dutch came back to kochin but with the help of Simhalese forces the Dutch attacked Marthanda Varma. Four days serious battle took place from 10th August 1741 at Kolachchal. Finally Travancore army had an upperhand in the battle and 24 important officers of the Dutch were taken as prisoners. The Dutch suffered huge losses. After the battle he did not keep quite. He decided to route out the Dutch from India and established the trade rights of pepper in Kerala and Tamilnadu. He also got back the ports which were in the control of the Dutch. Kochin was recognised as a centre of spice trade during the period of Marthanda Varma Travancore became the richest province. Finally on 15th August 1753 a treaty was signed and the Dutch forces surrendered its power to the Travancore province. This is how the period of Marthanda Varma has been recognised as an important phase in the history of India. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 4 The rise of the english in India and the acquisition of the Islands of South-East Asia by the Dutch were the factors for the decline of the Dutch power in India. Know this: The Warehouses were places for storing merchandise. Huge walls were built around these warehouses to provide protection. The English: On 31st December 1600, Queen Elizabeth issued a royal charter authorizing the East India Company to trade with Eastern countries for fifteen years. The company started the trade formally in 1613. The Mughal Emperor Jahangir issued a royal permission to English to establish their first warehouse or factory at Surat. In 1617, Sir Thomas Roe arrived at the court of Jahangir as the royal ambassador from the court of James I. He sought permission from Jahangir to establish factories in other places of Mughal Empire. The English established factories at Agra, Ahmedabad and Broach. In 1639, the English took Madras from the King of Chandragiri an", "d established a strong fort named St. George Fort. Later, Charles II, the Prince of England, gave Bombay on an annual rent of ten pounds to East India Company in 1668. In 1690, the English purchased three villages namely Sutanauti, Calcutta and Govindapura on the banks of Hooghly River and built Fort William. The city of Calcutta grew around this fort. By the end of 17th century, the English had established Bombay, Madras and Calcutta as the centers of their Presidencies. By the later part of 18th century, the English made Calcutta their capital city. They implemented their own civil and criminal procedure codes in the areas that were under their control. The French: The French East India Company started as a government owned company in 1664. It started its first factory at Surat in the year 1668. Later they established its factories in Machalipatinam, Chandernagore, Mahe, Karaikal, Cassimbazar, Balasore. In 1674, the French took Valikandapuram from a local Muslim official and developed it as a major trade center. Later it came to be known as Puducheri or Pondichery. This became the Capital of the French till they left India. Dupleix, who arrived (1746) in Pondicherry as the Governor General of the French had the high ambitions of establishing the French as a major power in South India. This ambition led to the Carnatic wars with the English. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 5 The Competition between the English and the French The Portuguese and the Dutch had withdrawn from India unable to withstand the competition from French and English by the middle of 18th century. Finally, the French and the English resorted to show of strength in order to establish their political supremacy over India. Meanwhile, political in Instability arose in the regions of Hyderabad and Carnatic (Eastern part of Tamil Nadu) and both the English and French tried to exploit the situation in their favour. This led to three Carnatic Wars. KEY B - British F - French D - ", "Dutch P - Portuguese ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 6 Know this Hyderabad Kingdom was established in 1724 by Asaf Jha. His feudatory Dost Ali who was ruling Carnatic region was not loyal to him. The Marathas killed Dost Ali in 1740 and looted Carnatic and imprisoned his son-in-law Chandasheb in Satara. Asaf Jha named Anwaruddin as the Nawab of Carnatic in the place of Dost Ali. First Carnatic War (1746-48): On the request of Dupleix, La Bourdonnais, a French military leader from Mauritius invaded Madras and captured it from the English. This forced the helpless British to request the help of Anwaruddin, the Nawab of Carnatic. The army sent by Anwaruddin failed to defeat the French at Madras. Finally, La Bourdonnais took money from the English and returned Madras and went back to Mauritius. This enraged Dupleix and he attempted to take Madras but failed. Finally, the war ended with a treaty in Europe between France and England called‘Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle’. Know this: The Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jha died in 1748. A tussle started between his son Nasir Jung and his daughter’s son Muzaffar Jung for the throne. On the other hand, a fight had broken out between Chandasaheb(who was released from the Maratha prison) and Anwaruddin in Carnatic. The French extended their support to Muzaffar Jung in Hyderbad and Chandasaheb in Carnatic. The English extended their support to Nasir Jung and Anwaruddin. In 1749, the combined forces of French, Chandasaheb and Muzaffar Jung defeated Anwaruddin and killed him in the battle of Ambur. As a result Chandsaheb became the ruler of Carnatic. Mahammad Ali, son of Anwaruddin, stayed at Tiruchanapalli with the help of the English. In Hyderabad, Muzaffar Jung became the Nizam by killing Nasir Jung with the help of French and Chandasaheb. He was killed after a few days. The French made Salabath Jung, another son of Asaf Jha as the Nizam of Hyderabad. Second Carnatic War (1749-1754): In the changed circumstances, ", "French made Salabath Jung, another son of Asaf Jha as the Nizam of Hyderabad. An officer named ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 7 Bussy was appointed in Hyderabad for his protection by the French. In the Carnatic Chandasaheb had become the Nawab with the help of French. Robert Clive of East India Company attacked Arcot, the capital city of Carnatic and defeated Chandsaheb. Chandsaheb was imprisoned and later killed in the war. In the place of Chandsaheb, the English named Mohammad Ali, the son of Anwaruddin, as the Nawab of Carnatic. The second Carnatic war ended with the Treaty of Pondicherry. the French recalled Dupleix. This war brought laurels to the English, while the French suffered a political setback. Third Carnatic War (1756-1763): Count de Lally of the French attempted to besiege the fort Wandiwash in 1760. In this decisive battle, Sir Eyre Coote of the English army defeated the French and imprisoned Bussy. Lally escaped and hid in Pondicherry. Finally, Eyre Coote attacked Pondicherry and Lally had to surrender unconditionally in 1761. The French lost all their bases in India due to the Carnatic wars. In spite of this, as per the ‘Treaty of Paris’ signed in 1763, Pondicherry was returned to French. With these developments, the French lost their importance in India. In this way, the English by defeating all their rivals, started consolidating their power in Southern India. Know this: Robert Clive: Robert Clive, who laid the firm foundation of the British power in India, had joined the East India Company as clerk. He played a decisive role in the Carnatic wars, particularly in the siege of Arcot and played a prominent role in the British victory. He was successful in establishing the British rule over South India and was instrumental in Bengal victory also. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, he gained control over the Nawab of Bengal also. Clive amassed immense wealth in all these ventures and helped the East India Company to earn mo", "re profit. Clive returned to England with immense wealth and became a Member of Parliament. With the return of Clive to England, the East India Company started facing losses in its business. Even though there were many allegations against Clive, the British government had to resend Clive to India to save the company and also save the face of the country. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 8 The British won the battle of Buxar and earned back its respect. Clive was successful in securing the Diwani rights for the British over Bengal, Bihar and Odisha regions. This brought more wealth to Robert Clive and to East India Company as well. In 1767 Robert Clive returned to England. Dupleix: Dupleix was named the Governor General of French regions in India in 1742. He dreamt of achieving French hegemony over India and entered into treaties with the local kings. Hyder Ali was also trained in the army of locals raised by Dupleix. The British considered Dupleix as a formidable challenge to them. Hence, we notice clashes between the French and the British to gain supremacy over the Carnatic and Deccan Plateau. Dupleix played an important role in the First Carnatic War in 1746. The rivalry between the French and the British continued till 1754. Later, the French government recalled Dupleix as it wanted peace. The British Rule in India After gaining political control over South India, the British tried to gain control over the rich Bengal province in the later part of 18th century. The Bengal province had achieved tremendous growth in the areas of agriculture, commerce and industry. The East India Company was making considerable profits from this province. The Dastaks (licence) issued by the Mughal ruler Faruk Siar were the main reasons for this. But, these Dastaks that were limited to the company transactions were misused by the individual officers of the company too. This resulted in huge loss to the Bengal government. Hence, all Nawabs from Murshid Ali Khan", " to Ali Wardhikhan opposed such misuse. This led to confrontation between the Nawabs and the Company. This resulted in two crucial wars which charted a decisive course to Indian history. Plassey and Buxar were those two wars. Know this: Dastak - a license that could ensure anyone to import and export without paying any tax and transport goods anywhere. Battle of Plassey (1757): Ali Wardi Khan, the Nawab of Bengal died in 1756. His grandson Siraj-ud-Daula came to the throne. The Battle of Plassey took place between the young Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah and the British in 1757. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 9 Reasons: 1. Misuse of Dastaks: Siraj ud-Daulah was furious that the Dastaks were misused by the officials of the company causing losses to the government treasury. 2. Mending of the fort without permission: The British repaired the fort of Calcutta and placed canons in them. This further angered Siraj-ud-Daula and he ordered the removal of the canons from the fort. The British refused to do so, angering the Nawab further. 3. Black Room Tragedy: Siraj ud-Daulah conquered Fort William easily and imprisoned some the of British. He imprisoned 146 Englishmen in a small room in the fort, of which 123 died. This is called the Black hole Tragedy. This enraged Robert Clive and arrived in Bengal with a huge army. Robert Clive attracted rich locals like Manikchand, Nemichand, Jagath Seth and others towards him. He was successful in convincing Mir Jaffar, the military head of Siraj-ud-Daula to stay neutral in the battle by offering him the post of Nawab of Bengal. Encouraged by these developments, Robert Clive declared a war against Siraj-ud-Daula on June 23rd, 1757. Everything went according to the plan of Clive. Siraj-ud-Daula who tried to escape from the battlefield, was captured and killed. Outcomes: 1. This war brought out the immorality, lack of unity among the Indians and the greed of Indian businessmen. 2. Mir Jaffar became the Nawab of Bengal. 3.", " The company gained exclusive rights to trade in Bengal. 4. Mir Jaffar had to pay Rupees seventeen crores and seventy lakhs to Sirja-ud-Daulah as war indemnity for the attack of Fort William. In a nutshell, Mir Jaffar became a victim of the company and its employees. Eventhough the treasury went bankrupt due to this greedy nature, the greediness of the company and its officials was never satisfied. The British projected Mir Jaffar as an inefficient Nawab and brought in his nephew Mir Qasim as the new Nawab. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 10 Battle of Buxar (1764): Mir Qasim was an efficient administrator. In the beginning he remained loyal to the company. He paid two lakh pounds to the company and gave away a few places to it. Shortly afterwards, he declared himself an independent King. After verifying the misuse of Dastaks, he declared all business was dutyfree in Bengal. Indians competed against the British in all spheres of business. As a result, the British trade suffered considerably. This was enough for the British to oppose the Nawab. They brought in Mir Jaffar again and dethroned Mir Qasim. As Mir Qasim knew the cunningness of the British, he went for an organized war against them. He was supported by Indian merchants and artisans. Mir Qasim entered into agreements with the Mughal ruler Shah Alam-II and Nawab of Awadh Shuj-ud-daula. The combined forces of Mir Qasim faced the British army led by Hector Munro at Buxar in 1764. Mir Qasim was defeated and ran away from the battlefield. Shah Alam-II surrendered. The efforts of the combined forces to stop the British failed miserably. Outcomes: 1. Shah Alam-II accorded the Diwani rights over Bengal to the British. 2. Shah Alam-II gave away all the rights over Bengal to the British for an annual fee of Rupees 26 lakhs. 3. Shuj-ud-daula the Nawab of Awadh had to pay war indemnity of Rupees 50 lakhs for waging a war against the company. 4. With the death of Mir Jaffar, the company paid pensio", "n to his son and took over the entire administration of Bengal. Know this: Diwani Right: The right to collect land taxes The battle of Buxar made the British the real holders of power over Bihar, Bengal and Odisha provinces. Even Awadh remained under their control. In 1765, Robert Clive brought in ‘Dual-government in Bengal’. As per this, the British had the right to collect land taxes, whereas the Nawab had power over administrative issues like justice and others. In this way, the British gained political control over India to protect their business interests. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 11 Know this: 1600 – The East India Company was established in England. 1602 – Dutch East India Company was established. 1617 – The Mughal emperor Jahangir issued a royal charter allowing the British to conduct trade in Surat, on the west coast and in Hooghly on the east coast. 1639 – The English established their first warehouse in Surat . 1664 – The French East India Company was established.

They gained complete political control over Bengal through Plassey and Buxar battles. By 1765, they had gained control over most of the eastern parts of India. Since the Marathas and Mysore states were dominant in southern and western part of India, the hold of the British was restricted to Bengal and Bombay regions only. Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan of Mysore along with Peshwas of Marathas were the only impediments in the path of expansion for the British. The others were Sikhs in the North western region. Ranjit Singh who emerged in the early part of nineteenth century was a formidable opponent to the British. He was successful in organizing the Sikhs. The British also waged repeated wars from mid eighteenth century to mid nineteenth century to extend their empire in India. Apart from this, they also annexed various kingdoms with cunning policies like ‘Subsidiary Alliance’ and ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. During this period, the British waged three Anglo-Maratha wars, four Anglo-Mysore wars and two Anglo-Sikh wars. The Anglo-Mysore wars are discussed in unit4, here we shall understand the wars of the British against the Marathas and Sikhs. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 14 Anglo-Maratha Wars First Anglo-Maratha War (1775-1782) The Marathas installed Shah Alam-II back on the throne of Mughal Empire in Delhi. Shah Alam-II was under the control of the British after the defeat in Buxar war. Now, the Emperor gave Kora and Allahabad to Marathas, whi", "ch he had earlier given to the British. This resulted in the enemity between the Marathas and the British. During this period, the death of the Maratha strong man Madhav Rao Peshwa was a major setback to Marathas. Though his brother Narayanrao came to power, he was murdered by his uncle Raghobha (Ragunatha Rao). This resulted in an infighting for the Peshwa post. The Maratha federation brought Madhav Rao II the minor son of Narayana Rao to the post of Peshwa. Upset with this development, Raghobha approached the British for support. The British thought of exploiting this situation in their favour. A long war was waged from 1775 to 1782 between the Marathas and the British. Initially, though the Marathas gained upper hand, later they had to lose Ahmedabad to the British. The Maratha federation was unable to sustain the war with the British and finally entered into ‘Salbai Agreement’ and ended the war. Madhav Rao II was named as the Peshwa. Lord Wellesley (1798-1805) and the Subsidiary Alliance: The expansion of the British Empire took place at a faster pace after the arrival of Lord Wellesley as the Governor General of India. By this time, the powerful states of Marathas and Mysore had become weak and expansion was easier. Lord Wellesley followed three policies to expand the British Empire in India. They were: Subsidiary Alliance, Waging war against new states and administering the states directly that were under the control of the British. Subsidiary Alliance: Lord Wellesley brought this policy into effect in 1798 in order to bring the local kings under control. This was basically a military protection agreement between the East India Company and the Indian State. The Conditions of Subsidiary Alliance: 1. The Indian Kings had to keep the British Army in their kingdom. 2. The state concerned had to bear the expenses of the army and the wages of soldiers, and also had to give certain revenue lands as well. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 15 3. T", "he King had to have a British Resident in his Court. 4. The King could not appoint any other European without the permission of the British. 5. In order to enter into any agreement or pact with any Indian state, the permission of the Governor General was mandatory. 6. In return for all these services, the Company would offer protection to the state from any internal or external aggression. The British could place the Indian states under their control through this policy and the maintenance of the army became easy. The Indian states were subjected to severe economic exploitation. Hyderabad was the first state to enter into this agreement. Later, Mysore, Awadh, Tanjavur, Maratha, Berar, Arcot, Poone, Gwalior and other states entered this agreement. Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-1805): The differences among the Maratha Chieftains was the reason for this war. There was enemity between Yeshwanth Rao of Holkar family and Daulath Rao of Sindhia family. Both wanted to establish control over the Peshwa Balaji Rao II. In 1802, the army of Holkar defeated the armies of Scindia and the Peshwa. The Peshwa appealed to the British for help.Lord Wellesley finally got an opportunity to meddle in the affairs of the Marathas. The Peshwa entered the Subsidiary Alliance system by accepting the Treaty of Bassein. Other Maratha families like Holkar, Gwalior and Bhonsle formed an alliance opposing this treaty. Lord Wellesley defeated the armies of various Maratha families from 1803 to 1805. But, his battle-thirstiness increased the financial burden on the Company. On being criticised for this policy, Lord Wellesley resigned from his post and returned to England. This resulted in temporary peace in the region. Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1818) The Maratha families tried their best to protect their independence and honour. Even the Peshwa attempted to free himself from the clutches of the English. In 1817 the Peshwa attacked the British Residency in Poona and burnt it down. Appa Saheb of ", "Nagpur and Malhar Rao Holkar ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 16 rebelled against the British and were suppressed ruthlessly. Finally in 1818, Peshwa Baji Rao II fought against the British at Koregaon and Ashti and later surrendered to the British. The British abolished the Peshwa post and granted a pension to Baji Rao II. They installed Pratapa Simha, the descendant of Shivaji as the ruler of Satara, a mini state, and named him as the traditional leader of Marathas and suppressed the Maratha resistance. The Consolidation of the British Power (1818-1857): The British completed their agenda of ruling the entire India from 1818 to 1857. They occupied major states like Punjab, Sindh, Awadh and many other smaller states. Anglo-Sikh Wars: A political anarchy broke out in the Punjab after the death of King Ranjith Singh in 1839. The British attempted to invade Punjab violating the Treaty of friendship of 1809, they had with the erstwhile King. In December 1845, a war broke out between the British and the Punjab. Sensing the danger from an outside force; the Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims got together to defeat the British. Finally, they had to accept defeat due to few traitor leaders. They signed a humiliating Lahore Agreement in 1846. With this the British Resident became the de facto ruler of the Punjab. Thus Punjab became the dependent state of the British. In 1848, the Sikh opposed the attempts by the British to rule Punjab directly. The opposition was led by ‘Chattar Singh Attariwala’ in Lahore and ‘Moolraj’ in Multan. Again the people of Punjab were defeated. Finally, Lord Dalhousie merged the state of Punjab with the British Empire. Dalhousie and the Doctrine of Lapse: Dalhousie who arrived in India as the Governor General in 1848 made a final attempt to integrate Indian princely states with the British Empire. He adopted the Doctrine of Lapse policy whereby the adopted children of Indian Kings were refused of their right to throne. According to t", "his policy, “If any Indian ruler died childless, his adopted children had no legal right over the throne”. Such a state was merged with the British Empire. Princely states like, Satara, Nagpur, Sambalpur, Udaipur, Jhansi, Jaitpur came under this policy. As ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 17 the Governor General knew the conditions of these states, he used this policy as a political weapon. With the severe implementation of this policy not only the princely families, even ordinary people who were sympathetic to these kings rebelled against the Company. Their love for their Kings and the sense of loyalty fuelled this rebellion further. This finally resulted in the First war of Indian Independence of 1857. Know this: Ranjit Singh: Ranjit Singh was born in 1780 as the son of Sardar Maha Singh who headed Sukerchakia misl, one of the twelve Misls of Punjab. He lost his father at the age of ten. When Shah Zaman of Kabul invaded India, Ranjith Singh offered his services to him. Shah Zaman made him the governor of Lahore along with the title ‘Raja’. He was nineteen years old then. Thereafterwords, he grew up in an amazing way. He aimed at achieving absolute power over all the Sikhs. He took control over all the Sikh Misls to the West of Sutlej and established his own Sikh Kingdom. He entered into a Treaty of Friendship with the British in 1809 at Amritsar. He organised his army on the lines of European armies. His army included Gorkhas, Biharis, Pathans and even Muslims apart from Sikhs. He established a Foundry (Workshop) at Lahore to manufacture Canons. The army of Ranjith Singh was the best among all the Indian rulers of that time. He was secular in temperament and supported both Hindu and Muslim spiritual leaders. People from all religions held high offices in his regime. He was successful in protecting his state from the British by not having any enmity with them. Meanwhile, even the British wanted a strong Buffer State to protect them from invas", "ions from the North West of India. In a nutshell, Ranjit Singh founded an independent Sikh state and ruled it as an independent king till his death in 1839. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 18 EXERCISES I.

The British East India Company fulfilled its commercial needs in the beginning as a Trade Company. On observing the fractured political landscape of India wherein hundreds of ruling dynasties were competing with each other, the British thought of exploiting the situation to further their political consolidation. They implemented ‘Divide and Rule’ policy among the Indian rulers and slowly dominated all the rulers and subjugated them. In order to achieve complete dom", "ination on India, they employed ‘War’ and ‘Negotiation’ methods cleverly. After getting India under control by employing various clever means, the British thought of strengthening their hold over India permanently. At that time, India was devoid of ‘One Nation Concept’ and was scattered into various kingdoms. The British integrated the whole of India under one administrative and political structure. Education, Judiciary, Land taxes, Trade and Agriculture and various other areas of activities were regulated under various laws and administrative system. This brought in a new structure to India. While implementing all these measures, they never forgot to protect their financial interests. The British East India Company implemented various administrative experiments in order to achieve a new order in India. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 20 Administrative and Judicial System Civil services: Lord Cornwallis introduced the administration of civil services. The system of appointing employees for the purpose of trade was done by the East India company from the beginning. The company also provided permission for private workers to trade. By using these opportunities employers made money became corrupt through illegal means. So to control this, in 1773 the government of England implemented Regulating Act in India. The aim of regulating act was as the name suggests to enforce control. In 1800, Lord Cornwallis opened Fort William College in Calcutta to provide education for the benefit of people aspiring to join Civil Services. But, this initiation did not find support from the directors of the East India Company. As a result, all the appointments till 1853 were done by the directors. From 1853 onwards, the appointments for Civil Services were done through Competitive Examinations. This did not benefit Indians much. The British continued to suspect the efficiency of the Indians. Lord Cornwallis argued “All the natives of Hindustan are completely corrupt", "”. As a result, only lower grade jobs were given to Indians. The Judicial System: A new Judicial System started finding roots when the British rule began taking over from the Mughal rule. After the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam handed over the ‘Diwani Rights’, the authority to collect land taxes to the British. With this, Dual- Administration came into effect in Bengal region. This is also called as ‘Dual-Governance’. Under this, the authority to collect land taxes, civil and judiciary were given to the Indian officials, whereas the British retained the authority of managing the revenue collected. Later on the British thought of bringing more centralized judicial system in India. With the implementation of this system, the British overtook the authority of the Mughal and established their supremacy in India. This was attained by implementing new Judicial System in India. According the administrative plan devised by Warren Hastings who took over the administration as Governor in 1772, two types of courts were needed to be established in each district: ‘A Diwani Adalat’ as a civil court and ‘A Fouzadaari Adalat’ as a criminal court. In these civil courts Hindus were dispensed justice as per the Hindu scriptures and ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 21 the Muslims as per the Shariyat. Slowly, the British legal procedures were introduced in the criminal courts. Civil courts came under the administration of European officers. Though the criminal courts were under the control of ‘Qajis’, they were functioning under the supervision of European officers. Police System: The Police are in charge of maintaining the internal law and order situation. Lord Cornwallis implemented the efficient Police System in India for the first time. He created the new post of Superintendent of Police (SP). He divided a district into many ‘Stations’ in 1793 and put every station under a ‘Kotwal’. Similarly he put every village under the care of ‘Chow", "kidhar’. ‘Kotwal’ was made accountable for thefts, crimes and other law violations at village level. The severe drought of 1770 led to a weak law and order situation. Hence, the entire police system was brought under the control of the British Officers. The system of appointing British Magistrates started in 1781. The Police Officers were under the power of the Magistrates. The Police system underwent continuous changes. In 1861, the Indian Police Act was implemented. This law became the base of good law and order as well as administration. But, Indians were not appointed for the post of officers. In 1902, the Police Commission allowed the appointment of suitable Indians qualified for the post of the police officers. In spite of all these measures, the discrimination against the Indians did not end. Military System: The Military was the base of administration during the British Rule. The British appointed the Indians for the military and took the entire India under their control with the help of the military. They protected their supremacy by addressing the challenges posed by outside as well as inside forces with the help of the military. The officers were again the British. The Indians could reach the rank of Subedar, the highest post available to them. Most of the Indians were Coolie Soldiers. The British Government accepted the recommendations of Peel Commission in 1857. Based on these recommendations, the Military System was redesigned. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 22 Land Taxes Policies: The East India Company had to pay four lakh Pounds to the British government for its control over Bengal Province. In order to fulfill this commitment, the Company had to stabilize its financial interests in a secured manner. Hence, it implemented many new land tax policies. Permanent Zamindar System: Lord Cornwallis implemented a new land tax policy in Bengal during 1793 in order to generate steady revenue annually. This was called Permanent Zaminda", "ri System. Under this system, Zamindar became the land owner. The Zamindar was expected to pay the agreed land taxes to the company on a set date every year. He was free to collect any amount of land taxes from the farmers and could retain the excess money collected. This benefited the Zamindar more. If the Zamindar was unable to collect land taxes due to floods and famine and pay the Company, the ownership of the lands was taken away by the Company. Both the Zamindar and the Company were benefitted by this system, but the farmers were the grave sufferers. This system created a new social group that aided the British. The farmers, the farming labourers suffered due to irregular working opportunities in the farming lands. They were exploited and had to lead a life of insecurity. This system was extended to Bihar, Odissa, Andhra and Varanasi regions later. According to Charles Metcalf, “the Indian farmers were born in debt, lived in debt and died in debt due to the land tax policies of the British”. Mahalwari System: The Company government entered into an agreement at the level of ‘Mahals’ with regard to payment of land tax in Uttar Pradesh, in many parts of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi. ‘Mahal’ means taluk. R.M. Bird and James Thompson implemented this system. There were differences in the implementation of this system from region to region. The big and small zamindars were part of this system. Since the company officials fixed more land tax than the expected production from the fields; many zamindars had to lose their ownership of the lands. The marginal farmers and agricultural labourers who were dependent on these zamindars also suffered due to this. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 23 Ryotwari System: The Ryotwari System was first implemented in Baramahal region by Alexander Reed in 1792. This system was later implemented in Madras and Mysore region by Thomas Munroe in 1801. Most of these regions had become part of British Empire by tha", "t time. Under this system, both the farmer and the company were directly linked. The tiller of the land was recognized as the owner of the land. The owner had to pay fifty percent of produce as land tax to the company government. The land tax had thirty years tenure. The tax could be reviewed after this tenure. Though the small farmers were given land ownership, they were subjected to more suffering due to heavy land taxes. The officials took punitive actions to collect land taxes. The farmers had to borrow from the money lenders whenever the crops failed. They had to sell their lands whenever they failed to repay the loans. Though the company government claimed that the new system benefit the farmers, the irony was that more farmers had to lose their lands due to its implementation. The Impact of British Land Tax system: 1. A new class of Zamindars who exploited the farmers was created. 2. The farmers who were subjected to the exploitation of the Zamindars, became landless slowly. 3. Land became a commodity. Loans could be raised by mortgaging the lands. 4. Many Zamindars also had to mortgage their lands in order to pay the land taxes. 5. The Agriculture sector became commercialized and had to grow raw materials needed by industries back in England. 6. The money lenders became strong. The Modern Education System The traditional education of Indians was in practice continuously. Certain changes occurred in the traditional education system during the rule of Muslim kings during the middle ages. Later, new changes occurred ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 24 during the British rule during 18th century. New schools were started for the children of British and Europeans living in India. Since these facilities were never extended to the locals, it was of no use for them. Warren Hastings facilitated the expansion of the modern education in India. In 1781, he started ‘Calcutta Madrasa’. Jonathan Duncan, a British citizen started Sanskrit College in B", "anaras in 1792. But, it was Charles Grant who pressed for the extension of British education in India. The expansion of the British Education India received special support after the appointment of Lord William Bentinck in 1828 as the Governor General of India. Bentinck appointed Macaulay as the member of Governor General’s Executive Committee. Macaulay was also appointed as the Chairperson of the Committee on Education. The report on Education submitted by him in 1835 became the base of modern education in India. His policy aimed at the “creation of a new class of Indians who are Indian by body but British in intelligence, opinion and taste”. The use of english medium in Indian learning system started after 1830s. Another important development included the establishment of Universities in India. The Governor General Lord Dalhousie established Universities in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras as per the suggestions of Charles Wood’s Commission (1854). After this, the education was universalized in India. The Impact of British Education in India 1. Indians could develop modernity, secularism, democratic attitudes and rationality along with Nationalistic ideals. 2. Impetus was received for the local literature and languages. This facilitated unity in thinking process among the educated class. 3. Periodicals started emerging. These scrutinized the policies and working of the government which in turn enabled the Indians to have critical opinions on various issues. 4. New social and religious reformation movements emerged. 5. The thoughts of thinkers like J.S. Mill, Rousseau and Montesquieu brought fresh thinking in the mind of educated youth of India. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 25 6. The freedom struggles that were taking place across the globe influenced the Indians also. 7. Indians could understand and appreciate their rich tradition. In this way, the new thinking and cultural perception that emerged due to the British Education System created a", " new generation of Indians with progressive attitudes. Constitutional Development Along with the British administration, problems also grew in India. In order to alleviate the problems, reformation in administration became important. And these reformations needed to address the demands of Indians. The British attempted to create different rules in the form of law and tried to implement them. These types of laws helped the evolution of Constitution in India. We shall study some of the acts in this regard. Laws Implemented during the rule of East India Company (1773-1858) Regulating Act - 1773: After the implementation of Diwani Rights in 1765, the greedy Company officials misused this provision and became rich in a corrupt way. Corruption spiraled out. Edmond Burk, a member of the British Parliament criticized the corruption in the East India Company. He criticised the tax payment received by the British Government from the East India Company as ‘Criminal Tax’. He was forced to criticize in this manner, as the government remained silent to the fact of corruption among the Company officials. Many Company officials had become super rich and many in England feared that these people may upset the very political setup of England. The Regulating Act was implemented in this background in 1773. Main features of this Act 1. Before the implementation of the act, there were three presidencies under British rule. They are: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. All these three were independent administrative units. Under Regulating Act, the Bengal Presidency gained control over the other two presidencies. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 26 2. The Governor of Bengal became the Governor General of all the three presidencies. 3. The Governor General was authorized to direct, exercise control and to supervise over the other two presidencies. 4. The Bombay and Madras presidencies could not declare war on anyone or enter into peace agreements without prior approval of the ", "Governor General of Bengal Presidency and the Board of Directors of the Company. Only during acute emergencies, they were entitled to act independently. 5. According to this Act, Supreme Court was established in Calcutta. In this central court, one Chief Justice and three ordinary judges were officiating. Like this, as the name of the Regulating Act suggests, the Act aimed at regulating the Company affairs and its administration in India under the control of the British Government. Pitts India Act 1784: There were many inconsistencies in the Regulating Act of 1773. In order to rectify them and also to clearly outline the powers of the East India Company and the British Government, Pitts India Act was implemented. The Government of England restricted the powers of the East India Company. Another important aspect of this Act was the establishment of the ‘Board of Controllers’ consisting of six Commissioners. The ‘Board of Controllers’ replaced the ‘Board of Directors’.This Board had powers to direct and control the issues related to Land taxes, Military and Civil areas. The Board of Control came into existence in the place of Board of Directors. This act declared that “the Indians have attained their paramount power in the name of the British Empire only, but not on their own” and curtailed the Political Rights of Indians conclusively. It declared that the areas under the possession of the East India Company were the integral part of the British Empire. Hence, the Government of England was the ultimate ruler of India. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 27 Charter Acts The main aim of Charter Acts was to extend the license of the East India Company. The Charter Acts of 1793, 1813, 1833 and 1853 were implemented to achieve this aim.

Apart from establishing political supremacy during the later part of 18th century, the British exploited the people in agriculture and trade in order to p", "rotect their own interests. These exploitations created insecurities across Karnataka. The local kings suffered insecurities. As a result, rebellions against the British broke out in most parts of the Karnataka. In the beginning, the Zamindars and Kings battled against the British individually without attaining unity among them. Wodiyars of Mysore (1399-1947) After the fall of Vijayanagara Empire, its traditions and the lost glory was revived and continued by the Wodiyars of Mysore. Hadinadu a Paleyapattu near Mysore town was ruled by Chamaraja a fendatory of Srirangapattana Mandalika. He died without any sons and the dalvoy maranayaka of karugalli administered it and demanded the princess in marriage to him. Nobody agreed for it. At this time Yaduraya with his brother Krishnaraya from Dwaraka of Gujarath came to Mysore. Voluntarily he came to help the Maharani and killed maranayaka. This pleased the Maharani who gave her daughter in marriage to him. Thus the Wodiyar dynasty was started. This dynasty was ruled by 25 Wodiyars starting from Yaduraya to Jayachamaraja Wodiyar. Let us understand some of the important Wodiyars. Raja Wodiyar (1578-1617): The credit of expanding the small paleyapattu into a large Mysore goes to him. Srirangapattana was ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 34 captured from the representative of Vijayanagara and made it as his Capital. Further the Surrounding areas were occupied and expanded his Kingdom. He revived the temples of Srirangapattana, Mysore and Melukote “Rajamudi” the crown was offered to lord Cheluvanarayana Swamy. He started the Navaratri festival in Mysore. Chikkadevaraja Wodiyar (1673-1704) : He was an efficient soldier and administator. He checked the invasion of Shivaji at Madurai, Ikkeri and Bijapur. He captured Magadi, Madhugiri, Koratagere and other places. He purchased Bangalore from the Moghul military general. He had the titles like Karnataka Kavichakravarthi, Aprathima veera, Thenkanaraja and Navak", "oti Narayana. He started the council of ministers (Athara Kacheri) to help in administration. The postal system came into being during his time. A dam was constructed across river cauvery and Chikka Devaraja and Dodda Devaraja Canal were also constructed for irrigation. He had Patronised many poets like Thirumalarya, Sanchi Honnamma and so on. Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan In the 18th century Indian History is considered as “The century of political problems.” There are many reasons for this. The death of Aurangzeb, the Moghul emperor in 1707 was the main reason. His death weakened the moghul empire. As a result the Moghul lost political control over South India. A lot of political struggles took place in Carnatic region. Before this, the death of Chikkadevaraj Wodiyar in 1704 created various political challenges in Mysuru state. His death created the problems of succession and administration. All these developments clouded the politics of Mysuru. Hyder Ali gained prominence in this scenario of uncertainity that clouded over the Mysuru and carnatic region. Hyder Ali soon became popular in using arms and experiments. He undertook the invasion of the forces by active military operations and suppressed Dalvoys. He imprisoned Krishna Raja Wodiyar II and kept him under house arrest and took over the power. He became famous as Nawab Hyder Ali in a short time. This situation was timely utilised by both the french and the english for their political power. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 35 Anglo - Mysore Wars (1767-1799) First Anglo-Mysore War: This was started in 1767 and ended in 1769. The Hyder Ali prominence gained by Hyder Ali in the South was not tolerated by the British, Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad. Hence, the British started devising cunning plans to defeat Hyder Ali whom they saw as an impediment for the expansionist ideas. Though, Hyder Ali suffered political and financial loss due to the Maratha aggression, he made attempts to have M", "arathas and Nizam of Hyderabad on his sides with little success. The British entered into an agreement with the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad against Hyder Ali. A tripartite alliance emerged. But, Hyder Ali with manipulative ideas was successful in breaking the alliance. He also created enemity and distrust among the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the British. Meanwhile, political disturbances emerged in Arcot. In 1767, Hyder Ali and the Nizam of Hyderabad attacked Arcot. But the King of Arcot had an alliance with the British. The war started with this incident. The battles took place in Thiruchanapalli, Thiruvannamalai, Ambur and other places. Hyder Ali organized lightening attacks in these battles. The British military captured a few places. Hyder Ali suffered few setbacks. The British Military from Bombay joined the war. Hyder Ali considered the war as a challenge to his personal power, and continued with the war. His army reached Madras by 1769 and created panic among the British. Inevitably, the British entered an agreement with Hyder Ali through the ‘Madras Treaty’. The first Anglo-Mysore War ended with the signing of the ‘Madras Treaty in 1769’. Second Anglo-Mysore War(1780-1784) The Madras Treaty had put the political developments in South India on a temporary hold. The British attempted to break the ‘Madras Treaty’. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 36 When Madhava Rao attacked Srirangapattana with the Maratha army, Hyder Ali expected the British to support him as per the Madras Treaty. But, the British rejected the request of Hyder Ali and went against the Madras Treaty. Mahe, the French colony was under the hold of Hyder Ali. The British attacked Mahe and captured it. This became the reason for Second Anglo-Mysore War. The Second Anglo-Mysore war was started in 1780. In the beginning, Hyder Ali gained upper hand. He captured many forts of the Carnatic region. Kanchipuram was captured by Hyder Ali. The Mysore army reached ", "till Coramandal beach. The British officers became worried. Hyder Ali attacked Arcot and captured it. He also threatened to attack Wandiwash and Vellore. An army was kept in standby by the British and it was led by Sir Eyre coot. He followed Hyder Ali’s army till Pondicherry. The French refused to support Hyder Ali against the British. Hyder Ali changed his war strategy with this development. He attacked regions under British control and captured a large booty of arms and wealth. In 1781 Hyder Ali was defeated in a battle held in Porto Nova by the British. This increased the confidence of the British and also changed the direction of the battle. But they suffered financial setbacks in Pulicat and Solingur. Meanwhile, by entering into the ‘Salbai Agreement’, the British were successful in winning over the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad to their side. Hyder Ali died due to illness during the war in 1782. The war was led by his son Tippu Sultan. Tippu Sultan was waging war in Malabar region when Hyder Ali died. The British tried to take advantage of Hyder Ali’s death by invading Mangalore and Bidanoor. They also tried to instigate the rulers of Calicut and Malabar regions against Tippu Sultan. Tippu Sultan thought of all these developments and decided to protect Mangalore and the coastal regions. He defeated the British. The ‘Treaty of Mangalore’ ended the Second Anglo-Mysore War in 1784. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 37 Tippu Sultan Tippu Sultan Tippu Sultan felt that the British were the major obstacle for his policy of expansion so he tried to drive them out seriously. He became the ruler of Mysore after Hyder Ali’s death. He understood the cunning policies of the British. He considered it as his duty to drive the British out of India. He waged war against the British throughout his seventeen years of rule. He had clearly understood the cunningness, strategies, clever manipulations of the British. He knew that hurting the business inte", "rest of the British would weaken the political strength of the British. He tried to organize the enemies of the British into one group. He tried to break the monopoly of the British over trade with India. These attempts further angered the British and their enemity with Tippu Sultan grew up. You Know this: Among all the attempts done during 18th century to stop the British, the efforts of Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan stand out due to many aspects. They knew that they could not defeat the British with their traditional arms. Hence, they modernized their army. The soldiers of Mysore Army were capable of using modern weapons and do drills like the European armies. Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan used missiles during the war for the first time in India. Apart from modern weapons, both of them knew that they needed funds in their treasury for the battles. Hyder Ali had witnessed many Nawabs going bankrupt while waging war against the British. So, both of them took measures to strengthen their economic system by entering into various agreements and trade pacts. They nationalized tobacco and sandalwood. They invited French experts to improve the quality of traditional artifacts of Mysore in order to gain better market share at international markets. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 38 Third Anglo-Mysore War The political situation of Travancore was the main reason for this war. The king of Travancore built a fort in Kochi with the help of the British and captured Ayacotta and Kanganoor forts from the Dutch. All these were the clear breach of Mangalore Treaty. The British captured Karwar, Coimbtore, Dindigul and other regions under the leadership of General Meadows. Tippu Sultan entered the region of Baramahal and captured Sathyamangalam. He later attempted to capture Thiruchanapalli but failed in his attempt. Meanwhile, Lord Cornwallis took over the leadership of the British Army and this changed the course of the war. The British Army captured Kolar and Ho", "sakote and rushed towards Bangalore under the leadership of Lord Cornwallis. The army captured Bangalore and destroyed the fort. After capturing Bangalore, Lord Cornwallis sought the help of Marathas and Nizam of Hyderabad to defeat Tippu Sultan. The war took another conclusive turn with the joining of the Marathas and Hyderabad forces with the British. The Marathas captured Savanoor, Gajendraghad, Lakshmeshwara, Hubballi and other places. The combined army marched towards Srirangapattana by capturing fort after fort in 1792. The fort was destroyed during night. Disturbed by these developments, Tippu Sultan tried to enter into an agreement with the British. It was inevitable for him. He signed the ‘Treaty of Srirangapatna’ in 1792 which had unfavourable conditions. With this Third Anglo-Mysore War came to an end. The British were successful in inserting unfavourable conditions in order to weaken Tippu Sultan. Tippu was forced to part with half of his kingdom, was forced to pay three crore rupees as war damage fee and had to pledge two of his sons as a guarantee against the payment. He was also forced to release the prisoners of war. The British withdrew the combined army from Srirangapatanam. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 39 Fourth Anglo-Mysore War Tippu Sultan took the defeat in the Third Anglo-Mysore war personally. He paid off all the dues and got his children released. He also gave away the territory to the British and its allies as agreed. He claimed his right over the Malabar regions under the British occupation. But, the British refused this argument. Lord Wellesley became the Governor General of India in 1798. The political activities against Tippu Sultan became intensified during this period. Tippu’s attempt to form an alliance of local rulers and his closeness with the French angered Lord Wellesley further. Tippu sent an ambassador to France to seek the alliance of the French. This enraged the British. They thought that an allianc", "e between France and Tippu Sultan would threaten the existence of British in India. Another treaty, Subsidrary Alliancen containing inhuman and impractical conditions was forced upon Tippu Sultan. Tippu rejected this. His refusal started the Fourth Anglo Mysore War. Mysore after Tippu The war started in 1799. The British were able to destroy the strong fort. Tippu died while fighting the British in 1799. With the death of Tippu Sultan, the British were happy as if the whole India came under ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 40 their rule.

Denying the right of adopted children over the throne was one of such rules. The rebellion led by Chennamma, the queen of Kittur opposing this law is a prominent one. Kittur lies between the Dharwad and Belagum. After the death of her husband Mallasarja, Chennamma, the queen of Mallasarja took active interest in the administrative matters. After the death of Mallasarja, his son Shivalingarudrasarja took ov", "er the reign of Kittur. Due to his failing health, Chennamma had to take care of day to day administration. Shivalingasarja supported the British during the Maratha war. As a result, the British entered into an agreement with Kittur and collected payment from him. This agreement was entered into during the time of Thomas Munroe. After the death of ShivalingarudraSarja, Chennamma adopted a boy named Shivalingappa and started ruling Kittur as a queen regent. Then, Thackeray was the Collector and political agent of the British in Dharwad. He sent a report to the Governor of Bombay and attempted to take over Kittur Kingdom under the Doctrine of Lapse policy. He attempted to take over the treasury and fort under his control. Chennamma considered war as inevitable. She prepared for the war. Meanwhile the British also prepared themselves for the war. In the battle, Thackeray was shot dead. Many British were taken as the prisoners of war. The British attacked Kittur again under the leadership of Colonel Deak. The army fought the battle bravely. Chennamma attempted to flee from the battle field. But she was captured by the British army. Chennamma and others were imprisoned at Bylahongala fort. Queen Chennamma passed away in the prison.

He was later released by the British. There are many oral histories about Rayanna. He developed a sense of nationalism and went on organizing an army. He organized secret meetings at sensitive places. He aimed at looting the treasury and taluk offices of the British. He had an army of five hundred men. He became furious with th", "e villagers who were assisting the British army. The British thought that Rayanna was being instigated by Rani Chennamma. Hence, they shifted Chennamma to Kusugal prison from Bylahongala. The British devised a cunning strategy to capture Rayanna. They encouraged Desais who were opposing Rani Chennamma. An Amaldar named Krishnaraya joined hands with them. Thus Rayanna was cunningly captured and brought down to Dharwad. Many of his soldiers surrendered after his arrest. He was declared as a main offender and was hanged to death at Nandagadh in 1831. Many ballads have kept the life and bravery of Rayanna alive even today. Rebellion of Amara Sullya This rebellion was basically a farmers’ rebellion. This rebellion needs to be understood in the backdrop of political situations prevalent in coastal Karnataka and Kodagu regions during 1835-37. The British dethroned the ruler of Kodagu, Chikkaveerarajendra of Haleri dynasty in 1834. He was later transferred to Vellore through Bangalore and later to Kashi. This incident created political insatiability in Kodagu. Swami Aparampura, Kalyanaswamy and Puttabasappa organized a rebellion against this. All the three declared that they were part of the Haleri dynasty ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 45 that ruled Kodagu. Swami Aparampura assumed the leadership of the rebellion. He was captured in 1834 and shifted to Bangalore. Similarly Kalayanaswami was captured in 1837 and placed in Mysore prison. Puttabasappa: The people of lower Kodagu continued the rebellion after the capture of Kalyanaswamy. Sullia, Bellare and Puttur, the major places of Canara region, were part of Amara Sullia. It is interesting to note that a farmer named Puttabasappa, as Kalyanaswami. This Puttabasappa later presented himself as Swami Aparampura. This also notes the fluid nature of the rebellion. Puttabasappa took over the leadership of the rebellion. The rebellion started in the hilly region. Puttabasappa organized the rebels and calm", "ed down the people. He declared that tax on tobacco and salt will be withdrawn, if the rebel government assumed power. The rich farmers, land owners and local chieftains were assured of this move. The capture of the government office in Bellare was the first move in this rebellion. Puttabasappa killed an Amaldhar who was known for his brutality. This further increased the popularity of Puttabasappa. This incident gained more support for the rebellion and the rebellion became more famous. The rebels marched towards Mangalore to capture it. The British were engaged in fortifying their fort in Mangalore. The rebels marched towards Mangalore through Panemangalore and Bantwal. They looted the treasury and prison of Bantwal. The British sought the army of Thalacheri, Cannanore and Bombay to quell this uprising. On hearing this development, Puttabasappa and his associated fled towards Sulya. The British captured them with the help of people in Kodagu. Puttabasappa, Lakshmappa, Bangarasa, Kedambadi Ramayiah Gowda and Guddemane Appaiah were hanged to death. Though the rebellion failed, it has an important place in the history of rebellions against the British. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 46 Rebellion of Surapura and Koppal: Surapura Surapura is at fifty kilometers from the present day Yadgir. This was an important place since the rule of Aurangazeb of Moghuls. During the reign of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Marathas it became a vassal state. Later, most of the territory was lost and Surpura remained restricted to a smaller territory. During the reign of Venkatappa, it raised a rebellion against the British. Venkatappa Nayaka: Venkatappa came to the throne after the death of his father Krishna Nayaka. He was born in 1834 and came to the throne at early age. His ascendance to throne was opposed by Krishna Nayaka’s brother Peddanayaka. This resulted in internal struggles. The British interfered in the affairs of Surapura. In 1842, they appointed M", "eadows Taylor as their Resident and gained proxy power over Surapura. Taylor was a reformist. He developed Surapura princely state. Peddanayaka was appointed as the Dewan of the state. Taylor conducted the land survey of the kingdom. The revenue of the state increased due to the measures implemented by Taylor. He took measures to educate Venkatappa Nayaka properly. He came to power in 1853. Rebellion of Surapura The British government was observing the various developments of Surapura. In 1857, it came to the notice of government that the representatives of Nana Saheb were present in Surapura. This made the British suspicious of King’s intentions. The British appointed an officer named Campbell to report on the various activities of the King. The officer submitted a report to the resident of Hyderabad that the King is involved in maladministration. Venkatappa Nayaka is usually presented as the leader of 1857 revolt in Karnataka by the historians. The British army captured Surapura in 1858. The war continued, there is confusion regarding Venkatappa Nayaka’s end. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 47 Veerappa of Koppal Koppal rebellion is an important rebellion in the various armed rebellions against the British. Koppal and the surrounding regions were under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad. There were exploitations. This enraged a few Zamindars who rebelled against the Nizam. Veerappa was an important person among the rebels. Veerappa who was a Zamindar, rebelled against the British and occupied the fort of Koppal and other forts in the vicinity. Many farmers and Zamindars supported after realizing his motives. The British contacted the Nizam and employed their army to defeat Veerappa. Veerappa who had lesser soldiers died fighting the army of the British. The Birtish captured back the fort of Koppal. Though, this rebellion was a short-lived one, Veerappa proved himself to be a good warrior. Rebellion of Bedas of Halagali Halagali is a small vi", "llage of Mudhol taluk of Belgaum district. This was part of the Mudhol principality. In 1857, the British banned the usage of weapons. The Bedas who always kept guns as part of their customs were good hunters.

Indians came into contact with Western civilization. As a result, they got the advantage of English education. Rationalism grew among Indians. It is a well-known fact that Do you know this? The British and Indian scholars who were influenced by the Western philosophers, called the 19th Century period ‘a period of Renaissance’. They adopted the same criteria in research about Indians as were used during the creation of European history. These writers firmly believed that India too, like Europe, needed a period of Renaissance to write history. Recent research has confirmed this fact. Many European principles relating to documentation of history have affected the writing of Indian history. this rational attitude stimulated the Indians to question superstitions and the contradictions in their traditions, and also become aware of their own interests. However, modern researchers are of the opinion that even in the pre-British period, in spite of the absence of the English language, Indians had a scientific outlook and were rational. Western thought introduced the ideas of democracy, freedom, equality and nationalism to Indians. Many who were enlightened by Western education, tried to bring in reforms. In this context, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Dayanand Saraswati, Mahadev Govinda Ranade, Jyotiba Phule, Swami Vivekananda, Annie Besant, Syed Ahmed Khan and other worked towards social reform. ©KTBS ", "Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 50 Brahmo Samaj Ram Mohan Roy was one of the important Activity: Make a list of the measures the government has taken to eradicate child marriage. Ram Mohan Roy person in establishment of Brahmo Samaj. He has been called ‘The Father of Indian Renaissance’. He had received excellent education. He was well-versed in many languages like Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, English, French, Greek, Latin and others. He had studied the culture and principles of religions like Hinduism, Islam, Sufi, Christianity and Buddhism. Raja Ram Mohan Roy studied the Upanishads and questioned the practice of idol-worship. He argued that modern science and English education were essential for an Indian revival. He opposed exploitation of women. He led an organized attack against the practice of sati and child marriage. Orthodox Hindus condemned him for such acts. Ram Mohan Roy supported the Prohibition of Sati Act which was introduced by Lord William Bentinck. He tried to develop rationalism among people through journalism. Towards that end, he started a newspaper in Bengali called ‘Samvada Kaumudi’. Brahmo Samaj was in the forefront of the social and religious reformation in the 19th Century. It attempted to bring in reforms in the traditions and customs in Hindu religion. It opposed idol-worship and polytheism, and encouraged monotheism. It condemned performance of yagas and rituals, and opposed the priestly class. Since English education exposed Indians to Western political thought, it enabled the development of nationalism among Indians. Arya Samaj Arya Samaj was established by Dayananda Saraswati. He travelled throughout the country giving lectures and emphasized that the Vedas were the source of truth and knowledge. In this context, he advised people to ‘Back to the Vedas’. He condemned idol worship and the caste system. He advocated that caste should be decided based on the ability and not on the birth of the person. He Dayananda Saraswat", "i ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 51 rejected the innumerable meaningless practices and dominance of the priestly class. He encouraged widow marriage. He urged people to use swadeshi goods. He propounded his teachings in a book called ‘Satyartha Prakasha’. ‘Purification Ritual’ was the main activity of Arya Samaj. The Samaj established schools and colleges in many places. The principles of Swarajya and Swadharma advocated by Dayananda Saraswati inspired people to take part in the freedom movement. Dayananda Saraswati who was a great patriot, proclaimed that ‘India should be for Indians’. Do you know this? Purification Movement The caste system and rigid beliefs of the Hindu religion had pushed people towards other religions. In this context, with an intention to integrate the Hindu society, Dayananda Saraswati reinterpreted the Vedas and advocated caste and gender equality. He began a Purification Ceremony to bring back to the Hindu religion all those who had got converted to other religions. Those who came back underwent the Purification ritual and were accepted by Hinduism. Thus he strengthened the Hindu religion. Prarthana Samaj Prarthana Samaj was established by Atmaram Panduranga in Mumbai. It was founded on the principle that service to mankind is service to God. It gave priority to spread of education. Through the Deccan Education Society, it aimed to develop the educational field. It encouraged widow marriage, female literacy, intercaste marriage, eating together by people of all castes, and opposed child marriage, caste system, idol worship and purdah system. It maintained that all religions were paths towards the truth and hence needed to be respected. During the Indian Renaissance, orphanages, national schools and shelter homes for women were established. M.G.Ranade popularized Prarthana Samaj. He believed that progress in the political and economic fields was impossible without reform of the society. He propagated Hindu-Muslim uni", "ty. Ranade was active in the National Congress party. He started a high school for educating girls. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 52 Satyashodak Samaj Satyashodak Samaj was established by Jyotiba Mahatma Joytiba Phule Phule. He believed that freedom was the basic necessity of every individual and that no individual could express his ideas if he did not have freedom. Satyashodak Samaj urged for prohibition of liquor. It vehemently opposed gender inequality, denial of human rights, exploitation of people and practice of untouchability. It started a movement for social justice. Jyotiba Phule established a primary school for girls. He condemned the slavery being forced on shudras and casteless classes including dalits, and denounced the people responsible for such slavery. He advocated free and compulsory education in order to bring about reform in the social system. Activity: Learn from your teacher about the various schemes of the Karnataka Government that encour- age women’s education. Shahu Maharaj who was deeply influenced by Satyashodhak Samaj, opened many branches of the Samaj and continued its activities. It began struggles on behalf of farmers. Phule wrote in detail about exploitation in his book ‘Ghulamagiri’ (‘Slavery’). Phule’s wife, Savitribai Phule too worked hard through the Satyashodhak Samaj, for women’s education. Later, Dr.B.R.Ambedkar was influenced by Phule’s principles. Aligarh Movement The Aligarh Movement aimed at promoting harmony Sir Syed Ahmed Khan of Eastern and Western ideas through transformation of the Muslims in their political, social, educational, religious and philosophical beliefs. The leadership of this movement was borne by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. With an intention to provide modern education to the Muslim community, he started ‘The Anglo-Oriental College’. Later on, this college was renamed ‘Aligarh Muslim University’. Its main objective was to provide religious education along with western education, and to ", "create a modern society through western education. Sir Syed remained outside the National Congress and ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 53 brought the Muslim community together. He supported female literacy and condemned polygamy and ideas against widow marriage. Ramakrishna Mission Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a priest at the Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Dakshineshwar Kali Temple. His thought was source of Indian culture. He considered all religions to be equal. He believed that spiritual realization was more important than any religion or God. He believed in idol-worship. He was a selfless devout person. Swami Vivekananda was his favorite disciple. Swami Vivekananda established Ramakrishna Mission in order to propagate the ideals of his teacher, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. The main objective of this organization was to spread the message of equality of all religions and to put that into practice. Ramakrishna Ashram has many branches all over the world. The mingling of ancient, modern and western thinkers can be seen here. Swami Vivekananda was a revolutionary monk who Swami Vivekananda opened the eyes of Indians to the importance of loving life. He stressed the significance of the individual, his presence and ability. He maintained that apart from prayer and practice of yoga, social service was also necessary for achievement of salvation (moksha). Ramakrishna Mission is continuing to nurture culture through education and social service. Vivekananda emphasized that nation and religion were like the two faces of a coin. Many national leaders including Gandhiji were inspired by the philosophy of Vivekananda. In 1893, at the Chicago Conference of World Religions, Swami Vivekananda upheld the greatness of India by advocating tolerance of all religions, and maintaining that all religions were true. In this manner, he introduced Indian culture to the world. He was a role model to the youth. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 54 Theosoph", "ical Society The founders of Theosophical Society (Brahma Vidya Annie Besant Samaj) were Madam Blavatsky and Colonel H.S.Olcott. This society was founded on the principles of establishment of universal brotherhood, comparative study of ideology, and exploration of natural principles and the latent energy of the individual. Annie Besant, an Irish lady started the activities of Theosophical Society in India and gave it new vitality. She aroused pride in Indian culture through her lectures. She attempted to establish equality, universal brotherhood and harmony in society. Annie Besant gave her full support to the freedom struggle. She started a newspaper called ‘New India’. In 1916, she started Home Rule movement. She was the President of the Congress Session in 1917. She contributed immensely to Indian philosophy and the Independence struggle. Do you know this? Home Rule Ireland was under the control of Britain. The Irish people began the ‘Home Rule Movement’ in order to obtain the right to carry on the administration of their country themselves. Influenced by this, Annie Besant started the movement in India too. In 1916, two Home Rule Leagues came into existence. One began under the leadership of Tilak and had Poona as its centre. It had its branches in Maharashtra, North Karnataka, Central provinces and Berar areas. The second League began under the leadership of Annie Besant and had Madras as its centre.

Those problems have to be solved through proper planning and good governance. In our democratic system people have to co-operate the Government-at central, state and local levels in-order to find with solutions to these problems. As such, is it not our ardent duty to know the problems of our Country? Of course, we must be aware of those national issues and find out suitable remedies also. Most of these problems are man-made issues and national hazards. Hence, we have to seek proper humanitarian solutions. Proper legislative reforms, able administration impartial judicial system and popular support are essential to find out remedies for these ills. Let us learn about these problems. 1. Communalism : Communalism is one of biggest evils of Indian society. It refers to the split of the whole national co", "mmunity on the basis of religion and it refers to the strong feeling that their group identities and interests are opposed to each other. Communalism creates religious division of society resulting in mutual distrust and threat. In other words, it manifests itself in social groupism, economic antagonism and even political rivalry. Communalism in India is a menace which is capable to disrupt the very unity and integrity of our nation. Communalism propagates hate- philosophy among religious groups. It leads to social unrest and even the ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 57 ruin of life and property. Communalism spreads with unwarranted mutual accusation and physical combat among the religion groups. The ‘Divide and rule policy’ of the British Government has considered the interests of religious groups above national interest. This hampers the unity and the very strength of the nation. Communal harmony is vitiated due to this philosophy as it spreads hostile atmosphere. So proper precaution has to be taken to curb communalism. Uniform legal system, equal treatment of all citizens, practice of secularism in all aspects of public life, furtherance of national feeling above the sectarian thoughts, are very essential to combat communalism. ‘Vote-Bank’, appeasement attitudes etc, politics will in the long run jeopardize the very unity and integrity. The division of national society on the basis of religion and preferential socio-economic treatment will aggravate the situation. On the other hand common and healthy national identities are to be developed among all religious groups in India. Religious fundamentalism should not be allowed to harm the national interests and Indian nationalism. Proper secular education to children can positively help to restrain communalism. Public awareness, political determination, administrative fairness, sound legal system, strong nationalistic ideology, healthy media all will have combined effect to combat communalism i", "n India. 2. Regionalism : Regionalism means the strong feeling of people in favour of the local area in which they live. A vast country like India naturally faces the problem of regional identities. To certain reasonable limit, this regionalism is considered tolerable. It helps the people to take initiative for the all-round progress of the local areas. But, many a time this extreme regionalism harms national unity and interests. Locally centered emotional attachment must be conducive to overall national growth. It is quite natural that regional historical background, social system, economic considerations, cultural diversities and geographical aspects- all have combined effect to promote regionalism. Linguistic fanaticism too leads to regionalism against nationalism. Glorification of parochialism or regionalism hampers the unity of the nation. The recent regional struggle in the Telangana part of Andhra Pradesh can be viewed against this statement. The regional struggles going on in various parts of the country too hamper the development of the nation. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 58 To counter this regionalism our Indian Constitution provides many remedial measures. It emphasizes national Unity and integrity by upholding single national citizenship. But, at the same time it provides enough space for regional development within the federal structure. The Preamble of our Constitution declares “We the people of India” and thereby stresses Indian nationalism. Reorganization of India on linguistic basis in 1956 should help to achieve progress of the states but it should not to lead to rivalry. among the states. If extreme regionalism among the states are allowed to continue, it will cause serious inter state-border disputes, river water disputes etc. This type of parochialism based on regionalism acts against national interests. Our Constitution provides proper platform for unity in diversity. Thus, healthy regionalism has to be developed alo", "ng with the strong nationalism in our Country. Parochialism exists even within a state. Special importance has been given in our state to remove any regional imbalance. Committees like Dr.D.M.Nanjundappa Committee, Malenadu Development Committee, Hyderabad-Karnataka Development Committee have been formed to achieve regional balance. The Union Government too has made attempts to curb parochialism by launching many projects for the development of the North-East States. 3. Illiteracy : In India illiteracy is a major problem. We are yet to achieve full literacy in our Country. Poverty, migration, child labour, child marriage, assignment of responsibility of baby care elderly children, lack of interests to give education to children are reasons for illiteracy. Education is important for national progress. In democracy every one should understand one’s duties and responsibilities. So that we can solve the problem of illiteracy. There was 12% literates in India at the time of Independence. It has been enhanced to 66% in 2001. By 2011 it has increased to 74%. Still about 26% are illiterates. Hence Government has taken up many steps to eradicate this problem. ‘Sarva Siksha Abhiyan’ has been launched in 2001 to provide free education for children of 6-14 years. It provides education to girls, physically challenged and Priority for women awareness. In 1988 Do you know this : “Democracy is only giving the opportunity to development of skills in equal”. Dr. S. Radhakrishna 2015’s UNO Millennium Announcement Compulsory primary Education and Gender equality. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 59 ‘National Literacy Mission’ has also been established by Government of India to make illiterates literates. ‘Sakshara Bharath’ programme has been launched to eradicate illiteracy. Recently through Article 21A of our Constitution education is made as fundamental right. Right to Education-2009 has been guaranteed. Compulsory free education has been implemented for the ch", "ildren between 6 and 14 years. 4. Corruption : Corruption is one of major problems of public life of our nation. Practically it is rampant in every walk of life and at every level. Corruption means an inducement to do wrong by bribery or other unlawful means. It is a departure from what is right and legally correct. It refers to improper and selfish exercise of power and influence attached to our public life. It is abuse of power for personal gains setting aside all rules and regulations. It is like an epidemic of public life. The negative consequences of corruption are many. It adversely affects the social, economic and political system of our country. In other words, it is anti -social and anti-economic. Corruption is politically unsound and ethically wrong. The level of corruption largely depends upon 3 aspects, i) Individual sense of values; ii) The set of socially accepted values as a whole ;iii) the system of Governance or administration. Bribery, nepotism, casteism, Red-tapism- all come under corrupt practices. It can be noticed that at the time of election itself unwanted corrupt activities start creeping into public life in India. Political corruption also leads to organized crimes. It may take shape of the white collared crime or public welfare offences. Even crimes like tax- evasion, hoarding, smuggling, misappropriation, fraud, violation of rules of foreign exchanges, professional misconduct come under corruption practices. Mere cynical view of living with corruption does not improve the situation. Strong moral urge at individual as well as society level is needed Activity: Imagine as a chairman of a Grama Panchayat and prepare plan and discuss about eradicating illiteracy in your panchayat area. Do you know this : Lokayukta Institution : Karnataka Lokayukta Act was introduced in 1986. It was headed by Lokayukta and Sub-Lokayukta. If corruption, unnecessary delay in work, then lodge the complaint there. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republi", "shed 60 to restrain corruption. Many a time, human weakness like selfishness, calculation of risk factors, personal gain do prompt the people to resort to corrupt practices. Lack of strict vigilance, and weak legal system give way for corruption. As such, in order to eradicate corruption, strong political will as well as public support are essential. In other words, good political leadership, sound bureaucracy and politically matured citizens with civic sense have to struggle jointly to control the menace of corruption. The offices of Lokpal and Lok Ayukta too have got corrective utility to control corruption. Educational Institutions, and Social leaders also have got their positive role in tackling these problems. Strict punitive measures have to be adopted while dealing with corruption at all levels in our country. 5. Status of Women : We could recognize the achievements of women even in Pre-Independence era. We remember Jhansi Rani LaxmiBai, Rani Chennamma, Anne Besent, Kasturba Gandhi etc. In these days women work as teachers, engineers. doctors, pilots, astronauts, police, politicians, defence personnel and so on. Still the status of women has to be improved further. Social system, poverty, illiteracy are the reasons for this backwardness. This poses problem to the national progress also. Indira Gandhi First women Prime Minister Prathibha Singh Patil First women President Sarojini Naidu First Women Governor Suchetha Krupalani First women Chief Minister To improve women’s education and development government has started Women and Children Development Department. Through this health; education and social status of women are improved. Women education, Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, Dowry Prohibition Act etc., are there for the empowerment of women. Activity : Discusses with your teacher about eradication of the corruption. Discuss : “You can understand the problem of a country by getting to know the status of women there”. Pt.J. Nehru. ©KTBS Not to be republis", "hed ©KTBS Not to be republished 61 Government of Karnataka has implemented ‘Stree Shakti’ programme for the development of rural women. There is a programme of loan and subsidy for women self-employment. Mahila Mandalas , Yuvathi Mandalas , Stree Shakti Organisations, Self-help groups and Women Co-operatives help for the all round progress of women. Women Commission at national and State level have been constituted to enquire the cases of women and impart justice to them. There is an effort to have the Reservation for women from Panchayat to Parliament. In Karnataka already 33% reservation has been implemented for women in local governments. Even in government jobs women reservation has been provided. In India Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister and Prathibha Singh Patil became President. A good number of women discharged duties as Governors, Chief Ministers, Ambassadors, and occupy many such high positions to day. 6. Economic Inequality : Increasing economic inequality has been a point of growing concern of India. It refers to the widening of the gap between the poor and the rich sections of the society. Even this inequality phenomenon is more and more significant between rural and urban sections. It has been observed that the rich and urban society is reaping more benefits of our national economic development. The poor are often disillusioned since the benefits of Governmental programmes do not properly reach the doorsteps of the poor masses. Even the high salary syndrome in the private sectors, the operation of multinational companies, the increasing segment of white collor jobs, profiteering, corruption- all have their combined effect to widen the gap between the ‘haves’ and ‘havenots’ in India. It is the primary duty of the Government to take steps for the bridging of gaps between the rich and the poor people. Planning in India should be inclusive and give proper attention to minimize these disparities. The poor and tribals should be made partners rather than v", "ictims of development. Many a time they are displaced from their land and dwelling places for establishing industries and constructing dams etc. At that time proper care has to be taken for their suitable rehabilitation and earning opportunities. Activity : Have an interview with the women members of your local panchayati about the status of women. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 62 Proper economic reforms, careful fiscal policies, healthy taxation system coupled with small scale and rural based industries would go a long way to remove this economic inequality. Growth of large industrial houses, monopolies are to be properly regulated. So that fruits of national growth can never be unequally distributed. Land reforms, labour oriented policies, social securities etc. too have positive role in minimizing this economic gap. 7. Over-Population : India is the second most populous country in the world. India possesses about 2.4% of the total land area of the world. During the decade of 1991-2001, population grew from 84 million to 102.7 million. As per 2011 Census the total population of India has reached to 121 crores. The growth rate of about 19% during the past decade. Increasing birth rate, decreasing death rate, raise of long lively period, decrease of infant mortality are the factors leading towards the over population in India. Family planning and Family Welfare activities like Mother and child Health Care Progammes are effectively launched in all parts of India. Of course, families especially middle and upper socio-economic classes have mostly adopted the Family Planning. Rapid population growth has created problems such as unemployment, illiteracy, poverty, beggary, housing, health, water scarcity etc. Moreover population of India is not equally distributed among all states. Even urbanization is taking place at a greater speed in India. Effective national population policies are to be implemented to tackle these problems. India can conveni", "ently convert these vast human resources as potential element of national growth. Our nation is having abundant natural resources. Planning at the national level should utilize harmoniously both natural and human resources. The Central Education Department is now called as Human Resource Development Ministry. The spread of literacy, technical training, agricultural development, industrial growth, export promotion, creation of employment opportunities both at rural and urban Activity : Collect the information about Govt of India’s employment garantee scheme. List out the advantages. Discuss : Population is supportive to country development and also dangerous. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 63 sectors are some of the means to tackle over-population. Nowadays, we can even observe a trend of dirth of labourers for agriculture, unskilled and even skilled work. This leads to migration of workers from one place to another.Economic growth has to involve more and more human potentialities. So that the problem of over-population will be solved within a decade in India. There are every possibilities that our human power can rightly be deemed as an asset and not as a liability with proper planning. 8. Poverty : Poverty is one of the foremost problems of India. It is the most widespread socio-economic problem of our Country. Poverty exists when people are not able to get sufficient food, clothing, housing and other basic necessities of life. Both in rural and urban areas in India poverty still exists. Since independence many programmes have been launched both by the Central and State Governments to eradicate poverty. BPL cards are issued to the poor families. Five year plans in India are directed to eradicate poverty and increase percapita income. Jawahar Rozgar yojana, Rural Employment Guarantee Programe, Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojanas are some of the schemes undertaken to reduce poverty. Ours is a country with vast natural as well as human resources.", " Proper utilization of these resources on productive lines could reduce poverty in our country. Increase in production and proper distribution of wealth can be achieved by economic reforms. 9. Profiteering : Profiteering means the excess profits earning trend at the cost of general public or consumers. This refers to the gaining of huge money by easy method in business. This easy money corrupts society. It creates economic inequality and enhances poverty. It even encourages crimes in society. In economic front profiteering is the result of unethical practices of trade. Continuous rise in prices results in inflation. This significantly erodes large chunk of the income of the masses. Unchecked price-rise is the main cause of undue profiteering. Increase in profit margin of producers and especially of distributors have paved the path for profiteering . This trend has to be properly regulated by the State authority. This necessitates Activity : Make a list of the programmes undertaken by the Govt of Karnataka to eradicate poverty. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 64 stabilization of price level. Monopoly of business houses, spread of multi national companies, unhealthy market practices, hoarding, black marketing, lack of proper price monitoring by commercial authorities are some of the factors which lead to profiteering. Proper governmental regulations, control of price index, expansion of cooperative marketing sector, proper taxation policy are some of the remedial measures to check the proffering. 10. Smuggling : Smuggling harms the national economic interests. Domestic industries and market suffer by the unsound practice of smuggling. It adversely affects the national economy and market conditions. Smuggling can be checked effectively by encouraging import substitutions. Suitable modulations of domestic market. prices, proper export-import policy (Exim) strict coastal vigilance service, punitive measures, and inter-state trade agreements are th", "e main remedies to check smuggling. Proper awareness among the citizens has to be created that smuggling is an anti-national and economically a crime. Social boycott of smuggled goods have an effect on checking smuggling. Indian citizens should not sit back thinking that the responsibility of eradicating the above-mentioned ills lies solely with the Government. Trying to tackle the problems at the individual level will lead to good results. EXERCISES I.

In seven C", "ontinents there are about 198 sovereign states. India is a sovereign nation which means supreme in both internal and external affairs. We, as an independent country, have to maintain good relations with all foreign states. Especially, our international relations with neighboring states in Asia must be very cordial. But, at the same time our national interests like border security, foreign trade, economic gains, reputation of the country etc. have to be carefully protected. Permanent diplomatic channel is maintained with all the countries of the world. Let us glance India’s relationship with some of the countries of our Family of Nations. 1. India and Pakistan: Partition of India in 1947 has led to the formation of Pakistan. We have got geographical nearness and common cultural heritage. We have shared common history of many centuries. India is keenly interested to have good friendship with Pakistan. But due to Military Dictatorships and political instability, Pakistan did not maintain good relationship with India. There were Indo-Pak wars in 1947-48, 1965, 1971 and again in 1999 (Kargil war). In all these wars India emerged victorious. Kashmir problem and terrorism are the major Activity: Read newspapers and collect information about Indo-Pak relations in recent days. issues which are to be solved effectively to have sound relationship. Nearly one-third of Kashmir is yet to be liberated from Pakistan. India is stressing that Pakistan should not promote terrorism and harm our national interest. Long term peace solution is yet to be formulated between India and Pakistan. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 67 2. India and China: China is our big neighbour country, situated in the northern part. Indo-China relationship has been developed in the course of our long history. In the modern period, India was the first country to recognize Chinese Communist Government in October 1949. Our aspiration is to have sound Indo-China relationship based on ‘Panch", "sheel’ and Hindi-Chinee Bhayi-Bhayi Principles. But such constructive, co- operative principles are not bringing expected results. China has annexed Tibet against Indian will. In 1962 China invaded India and won the war. China’s claim over Arunachal Pradesh, one of our states is a significant issue of Indo-China relationship. Maoists’ terrorism in the form of Naxalism in India is also casting a shadow on our mutual relations. Our border is also not finally demarcated. As such there is no well settled International Border (IB) but we do have only Line of Actual Control (LAC).Even nuclear threat, foreign trade challenges; military advancements in border areas are some of the issues which strain our relations with China. 3. India and U.S.A: Both India and the U.S.A. are bigger nations and have a democratic system. Our friendly relations are crucial in the present day World politics also. Our mutual relations since 1947 till now have undergone many swift changes based on mutual national interests. India being a NAM ( Non-Alignment Movement) nation has maintained equal distance between Democratic bloc of USA and Communist bloc of USSR during the period of entire bi-polar World. USA has helped us financially for our economic development through Five year Plans. Even during Chinese aggression in 1962 the support of the USA strengthened India. Later, the policy makers of the USA extended help to Pakistan in the Indo- Pak wars. Many a time her Foreign Policy has favoured Pakistan at our disadvantage. We have a common concern for curbing terrorism. India maintains good relationship with the USA in the fields of foreign trade, science and technology, space and education. Both the nations are bound by the principles of World peace and support for U.N.O. India is keeping a close watch on the foreign policy trends of her Democratic and Republic Party Presidents. Accordingly, we prepare our policy towards the U.S.A. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 68 4. Ind", "ia and Russia:- India maintains good relationship with Russia and it was so even with its predecessor, the U.S.S.R or Soviet Union. Though India followed the Non-alignment Policy, Indo-Soviet cooperation continued in political, economic and other fields. Though a communist country, Soviet Union condemned China’s aggression in 1962. During the liberation of Goa in 1961 Soviet Russia supported India. In 1966, Tashkent Agreement was signed by India and Pakistan with the mediation of Russia. In 1971 India and Soviet Russia entered into 20 years Treaty of Peace, Friendship and cooperation. Russia assisted India to have steel plants at Bhilai and Bokoro. We have received a lot of aid from Russia for the growth of our industry and commerce. It is supporting Indian claim for permanent seat in the Security Council of UNO. India has relations with its nearest countries like Bhuthan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Maldives, Indonesia, Srilanka and Bangladesh. EXERCISES I. Fill in the blanks with suitable words: 1.

For instance, opportunities for good nutritious food, school, employment are more for children born in rich families. Children in poor families lack such opportunities. Children are not responsible for the segregation of people as rich and poor. But they have to reap the evil effects of stratification created by society. Various kinds of social stratification can be seen in different periods and in different countries. For instance, the caste system has been in existence in India from thousands of years. This system determines whether the person belongs to the upper caste or the lower caste. Thus, some people belonging to certain low-castes were considered shudras and untouchables, and they were deprived of right to food, employment and even right to life. Governments in India have striven to provide a constitutional remedy for this injustice. Stratification can be seen in all societies. The whites in America treated the blacks as slaves and traded in them. Similarly, discrimination is made everywhere between the haves and the have-nots. Activity: Collect information about the projects of the government has undertaken to eradicate discrimination in society. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 70 The system of social stratification leads to inequality and differences. It humiliates the people classified as the low class. For example, the blacks in America were not permitted to attend the schools of the whites. In India, untouchables were not allowed to take water from public wells or lakes. Prejudice created due to discrimination: The great Kannada poet, Pampa declared: ‘Truly, the whole mankind is one’. (ªÀiÁ£ÀªÀ PÀÄ® vÁ£ÉÆAzÉÃ ªÀ®A) This denotes that all human beings are one. In spite of this, people practice various kinds of discrimination based on caste, gender, region, rich and poor, which create many prejudices in the minds of people. Prejudice is the opinion a per", "son forms about another person or community even before he gets to know them. This kind of opinion may be positive or negative. However, prejudices created by discrimination lead to development of feelings like impatience, contempt, disrespect and hatred. As a result, social inequality develops leading to social conflicts. Untouchability- a social evil: The stratification in India can be seen in the caste system. People in India are spread among innumerable castes. Some castes among these are considered to be high whereas the others are considered to be low. Untouchables had been considered to be at the lowest rung in society in this caste stratification. Untouchability is an inhuman practice of our society. Mahatma Gandhi called it a ‘stigma’ on the Hindu society. Due to the practice of untouchability, people victimized by it were deprived of social, cultural, religious, educational and political facilities and opportunities. This condition continued for some centuries. However, the situation has changed now. At present, the constitution guarantees the provision of all facilities to people of all classes and castes. People belonging to backward castes and classes are getting special facilities. The practice of untouchability is dying down as a result of the gradual increase in literacy. This is a heartening development, and has helped to promote social harmony. Measures to eradicate untouchability: Jyotiba Phule, Swami Vivekananda, Dr.B.R.Ambedkar and others made immense efforts to wipe out the stigma of untouchability. In spite Do you know this? Positive prejudice or bias: Usually we consider ‘our people’ as ‘good’. This feeling helps us to live in harmony. However, if it becomes intense, it can be detrimental. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 71 of their attempts, it has not been eradicated completely. Many laws have been brought into force to control it. Section 17 of the Constitution prohibits the practice of untouchability. The ‘Untoucha", "bility Crime Act’ was implemented in 1955. Some lacunae of this Act were rectified and the Act was amended as ‘Citizens’ Rights Protection Act’ in 1976. According to this Act, practice of untouchability is a punishable offence. Besides, universal suffrage and right to equality have been guaranteed in the constitution to all citizens of the country. All people belonging to backward castes, especially the scheduled castes, have been provided reservation in educational, political, economic and employment opportunities. The Regulation of 1989 confers special responsibilities to the state governments with regard to eradication of untouchability. In this manner, independent India has been striving to provide equal opportunities to all its citizens by showing great interest in curbing the evil practice of untouchability. EXERCISES I Fill in the blanks with suitable words: 1. ‘Truly the whole mankind is one’ is declared by __________. 2. ‘Untouchability is a stigma on Hindu religion’. This was told by _________ 3.

If an individual is able, through the exercise of his energy or effort, to get economic benefit or any other benefit in material form, it is called labour. Labour is an integral part of our economic life. It is essential to lead one’s life. Labour is related to the external purpose of material benefit and involves effort. In addition to this, there is also the factor of fulfillment of basic requirements of life. Depending upon the economic life, the work assumes various forms and varies from society to society. It also varies from time to time. Division of Labour and classes: Division of labour means work being done by people depending on their interests, tastes, abilities, age, expertise, skills and gender. For ex: the cloth that we wear is manufactured by the collective effort of agriculturists, weavers, dyers, traders and tailors who work at different places. Division of labour leads to specialization. Specialization means achieving sufficient expertise, training and skill in any particular field. Division of labour has helped people to work in various fields and earn economic profit. This has led to the creation of economic strata and class system has been created by Division of Labour. In modern days class system was created by industrialization. In today’s industrialized society, specialization has become very important. With specialization developing in every field,", " industries have grown in number. Trade and commerce have expanded. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 74 Paid work and unpaid work: Work that provides wages, salary or any other material benefit is called ‘paid work’. Engaging in various activities like ploughing in fields, working in factories, teaching in schools, constructing buildings, repairing vehicles etc. has become inevitable in today’s complex society. All human activities cannot be called work. Any activity undertaken for self-satisfaction cannot be called work. It is an activity without material benefit. Activities indulged in without any definite purpose, but which give mental satisfaction are called unpaid work. Ex: an artist painting a picture for his own satisfaction. etc., But in the caste and race system black and lower caste people were forcefully working without pay. Labour Discrimination Inequality at work and in wages is called labour discrimination. Although both men and women are engaged in work, their jobs may not be the same. In most countries of the world including India, men are offered better jobs. Similarly, higher responsibilities and remuneration are also extended. Women get lesser responsibilities and remuneration. However, in the governmental sector, discrimination is rare. It is found more in unorganized sector. There is another form of discrimination as regards work of men and women. Nowadays, women are taking up employment in huge numbers. However, there is discrimination in the remuneration given to them. Though they do exactly the same kind of work as men, the fact that they are being paid less is nothing but exploitation. To put an end to this problem, the Central Government has enacted Equal Wages Act in 1976. In the organized sectors of major cities, this sort of discrimination is coming down. Even the agricultural sector practices discrimination based on gender, age and ability. Here too, there is inequality in the payment of wages. As literacy is slow", "ly improving, this kind of discrimination is coming down. Unemployment One of the major problems that is haunting the country’s economic development and social structure is unemployment. Backward and developing countries are already in its stranglehold. In India, this has ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 75 become a serious problem. Unemployment means inability to get work in spite of proper age, ability and interest. Those who are willing to work but are denied an opportunity to do so, are called unemployed. Over-population, mechanization, too much of division of labour, Social inequality, insufficient capital and illiteracy are the causes for unemployment. Unemployment leads to poverty, ill-health, crimes, corruption, family disintegration, cheating, deception, robbery, prostitution etc. This is a serious social malady. Remedies for unemployment: To tackle the problem of unemployment, the government has planned many programs. They are: population control, encouragement to cottage industries, agricultural development, industrial development, educational reforms, five- year plans, encouragement to vocational education, rural development, employment- guarantee programs etc. In recent years, information technology has made significant progress in the country resulting in innumerable employment opportunities in the service sector. Do you know this? Today rural areas are witnessing a shortage of qualified, employable youth rather than lack of employment opportunities. The reason for this phenomenon is that the rural youth are migrating to the cities in search of better employment opportunities, thereby creating an acute shortage of hands in the agricultural sector. Similarly, in the cities, there is a shortage of skilled people. Organised And Unorganised Workers Organised Workers : Those who are working in specific fields which are governed by legal rules and regulations are called Organized workers. In the organized sector, every employee’s work ", "is subject to specific terms and conditions. Discuss : Unemployment is not a problem. Though there are opportunities for employment, we create unemployment by not utilizing those opportunities. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 76 In the organized sector, there is organizational hierarchy. The workers enjoy facilities of specialization, training, talent, experience and educational qualifications. These employees’ day to day transactions are recorded in written form. They get fixed wages, allowances, paid leave and pension facilities. In addition, they get medical facility too. They have specific hours of work. The workers in insurance companies, educational institutions, banks armed forces, private companies, government departments are identified as organised workers. Unorganised Workers : People who work in areas which are not governed by specific rules and regulations or unions, and lead their lives by earning daily wages or material benefit in any other form, are called unorganized workers. Since unorganized sector is very vast, it is not under governmental control. For ex: domestic servants, construction workers, agricultural labours, footpath hawkers, vehicle repairers, push-cart vegetable vendors etc., also come under this group. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 77 Problems of Unorganized workers : The work of unorganized workers is not bound by any rules or regulations. They get only wages for their work without any additional facilities or medical help. They are denied of job security, fixed wages and allowances. Sometimes unorganized workers were harassed by entrepreneurs. EXERCISES I Fill in the blanks with suitable words: 1. Division of labour leads to __________. 2.

This variety is unique to our country in the entire world, and as such, has given a rich heritage. When we observe a deverse of physical features, climatic conditions, natural vegetation and people, we feel this country can be called a subcontinent. India’s position in the world: India is a peninsula located in South-East Asia. It is also called ‘India’ and ‘Hindustan’. The name ‘India’ has been derived from rever Indus. It has been named ‘Bharat’ after the ancient Indian king Bharata. The country is entirely in the northern hemisphere. It is wide in the north, tapering to form a triangle in the south, ending in the Indian Ocean.

PHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA India has different types of relief features. These are found in different parts of the country. Their history dates back to different geological periods and there are differences in the structure and surface features. Based on these differences, the country is divided into four major divisions: 1. Northern Mountains : The Himalayan mountain the highest in the world and consists of highest peaks, deep valleys, Glaciers rivers etc. The Himalayan range begins at the Pamir Knot in the west and extends upto Arunachala pradesh in the east. It is about 2500 kms in length. These folded mountain ranges are three main ranges: 1. Siwalik mountains (foothills of Himalaya) 2. The Himachal (middle Himalaya) 3.The Greater Himalayas (Himadri) a) Siwalik Range : These hills are the most recent formations and are located in the southern part. They have lesser height. They are also called ‘the Foothills’ of the Himalayas. These hills have narrow strips of plains or valleys which are called “Dunes”. For example. Dehradune, Kota, Patli and chaukhamba, Udhampur and Kotli. These are about 600-1500 meters above the sea level. b) The Himachal (Middle Himalaya) (central) : They are about 3600 meters to 4,500 meters in height and are located between Siwalik and the Greater Himalayas. They are about 60-80 kms in width. The lesser Himalayas consist of many parallel mountain ranges. For ex.Pir Panjal, Mahabharath range, Nagtibba, Mussoorie, etc. Kangra and Kulu are the famous valleys. Shimla, Mussorie, Nainital, Ranikhet, Chakrata and Darjeeling are the well known hill stations. c) Greater Himalayas (Himadri) : These are known for the highest peaks of the Himalayas and the earlier formed ranges of the Himalayas. This range is completely covered with snow. Hence it is called ‘Himadri’ ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 83 (abode of snow). This is about 6000 meters to 8000 meters above", " sea level. The highest peak, ‘Mount Everest’ (8848 meters) lies between Nepal and Tibet. Other peaks of this range are Kanchenjunga, Dhaualagiri, Nanda Devi, Gowrishankara etc. These peaks have many glaciers, the most famous among them being Gangotri it is the origin of river Ganga. There are many passes which not only provide transport facilities but are also excellent tourist attractions. They are Kashmirs Burzil, Zojila, Barala cha of Himachal pradesh. The range of fold mountains lying to the north of the Greater Himalayas is called ‘trans Himalayas’. This consists of Karakoram range and Kailash range, Godwin Austin or K2 is the highest peak in India (8611 mts). Ladakh plateau also lies in this region. Importance of the Himalayas: The Himalayan mountains have influenced the life of Indians to a greater extent. They provide protection to India, by obstructing the cold winds from the sibenian regions. They are the birth-place of many rivers. They facilitate hydro-electric power generation. They are the home to many types of plants and animals. They are a great treasure-house of minerals, and are also significant for tourism and religious centers. 2. Northern great plain : The Great Plains of the North are also called ‘Sutlej-Ganga plains’. They are found between the Himalayan Mountains of the north and the Peninsular Plateau in the south. These plains stretch from the plains of the river Indus in the west to the Brahmaputra valley in the east. Their breadth is around 2,400 kms whereas the width is 70 km to 500 kms. This area has the least variation in height and is completely flat. The entire plain is formed by the deposition of alluvial soils brought by the rivers which rises in the Himalayas. Do you know this? Babar, Bhangar and Khadar: When the Himalayan rivers enter the plains, they deposit of rock there. These are called ‘Babar’. The area with loamy soil deposited of the ancient times is called ‘Bhangar’. The loamy soil formed in recent times is called ‘Khada", "r’. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 84 3. Peninsular Plateau: The Peninsular Plateau is the largest of all physiographic divisions of India. Moreover, it is the most ancient, and is a part of the Gondwana landmass which existed in the early stages of the earth. The Peninsular Plateau stretches from the south of the Sutlej-Ganga plains upto the Indian ocean in the south. Its total area is ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 85 around 16 lakh sq.km. It stretches from the Aravalli mountains in the north to Kanyakumari in the south. It extends approximately 1400 kms. from the Western Ghats in the west to the Rajmahal hills of Jharkhand in the east. This peninsular Plateau is in the formed in triangular shape being broad in the north and narrow towards the south. It is bounded by the Arabian Sea in the west, Bay of Bengal in the east and the Indian ocean in the south. In the North of Peninsular Plateau, we find mainly the Vindhya mountains, Satpura hills, Malwa plateau, Chotanagpur plateau and rivers like the Narmada, Tapti and Damodar flow amidst these, along with many small rivers. All these are together to the north of Narmada referred to as the ‘Central Plateau’. To the south of these, there is the Deccan Plateau. Mahadev and Maikhal ranges, Amarakantak hills, Rajamahal hills are to the north of Deccan plateau. To the west of the Deccan Plateau, there are the Western Ghats. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, these are referred to as ‘Sahyadri’. ‘Anaimudi’ peak (2665 meters) in Annamalai range is the highest peak in South India. To the east of the Deccan Plateau, there are the Eastern Ghats. They meet the Western Ghats in the Nilgiri hills. The Eastern Ghats are not very high or continuous. In the Eastern Ghats, Armaconda and Mahendragiri are the highest peaks. These Ghats are separated by river valleys here and there. The Peninsular Plateau has great economic significance. The reason for this is that it has rich deposits of mine", "rals. As the rivers have many form waterfalls, the best suited for the production of hydro-electricity. 4. Coastal Plains : Apart from the islands, India has a coastal line of 6,100 kms. Starting from the Kutch region of Gujarat, the coastline extends upto Gangetic river basin in the east. The narrow plain along the coast is called the coastal plain. The Indian coastline is divided into West coast and East coast. The West coast spreads from Kutch of Gujarat in the north between the Arabian sea and the Western Ghats upto the Cape of Kanyakumari is the south. It is 1,500 kms long. This is further divided into Malabar coast in Kerala, Canara coast in Karnataka, Konkan Coast in Goa and Maharastra ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 86 and Gujarath coast. Mumbai, Marmugoa, Cochin, Kandla, Karwar and Mangalore are the major ports of this coast. The Eastern costal plains extends from Kanyakumari in the south to the Gangetic river in the north. The East coast is located between the Bay of Bengal and the Eastern Ghats. This coastline is very wide and flat. It comprises the deltas of Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery rivers. In the east coast, there are some salty, brackish-water lakes or lagoons. Chilka lake of Orissa and Pulicat lake of Tamil Nadu are the important. The east coast is divided into Utkal coast in the north and Coromandel coast in the south. Islands: There are totally 247 islands belonging to India. Of them, 204 are in the Bay of Bengal and 43 are in the Arabian Sea. In the Gulf of Mannar, there are a few coral islands. Andaman and Nicobar islands in the Bay of Bengal are formed from hard volcanic rocks. Lakshadweep islands are coral islands. India’s extreme southern tip is located in the great Nicobar island. This is called Indira Point. EXERCISES I Fill in the blanks with suitable words: 1. The name ‘India’ is derived from the river ___________. 2. The total area of India is ____________ sq.kms. 3.

In this type of climate, winds blows in opposite directions in different seasons. India depicts all the typical features of You should know this. The word Monsoon is derived from an Arabic word ‘Mausim’. It means seasons. tropical monsoon. During the first half of the year, the winds blow from south-west to north- east, and remaining half, they blow from north- east to south-west. In addition to this, geographically. India is situated both in tropic and temperate zones. Latitude, height from the sea level, distance from the sea, direction of the winds, mountain ranges, ocean currents etc., are influence on the climatic condition of the country. Indian climate divided into four seasons: 1. Summer season: March to May 2. South-west Monsoon season: June to September 3. Retreating monsoon season: October to November 4. Winter season: December to February Summer season: The summer season begins from the first week of March and it continues till the end of May. During this season. The sun rays are perpandicular in the Northern hemisphere. Hence temperature will be high. Days are quite long. The North-Indian plains are away from the sea and have very high temperature. Rajasthan’s Ganganagar of records a maximum of 52°C in summer, and it is the hottest place in the country. In contrast South India is surrounded by water on three sides, and as such temperature is moderate seen. It will be between 32° C to 35° C. During this season, the North-Indian mountain regions and the peninsular plateau are cooler. Due to local temperature and winds, rainfall occurs ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 89 in some places during April and May. These are called ‘Kala Baisakhi’ in West Bengal, ‘Andhis’ in Uttar Pradesh ‘coffee blossoms in karnataka’ and ‘mango showers’ in Ke", "rala. In summer, the country receives only 10% of annual rainfall. South-West Monsoon (Rainy season) : In India, the South-West Monsoons comprise the rainy season. These are called the South-West Monsoon winds. These are very humid and shower rain most parts of the country. This seson spreads from June to September 75% of the rainfall occurs during this season. South West Monsoon separates India into two braches: one is the Arabian Sea branch and the other is the Bay of Bengal branch. Monsoon winds are obstructed by the Western Ghats and as such, maximum rainfall is seen to the west of the Ghats. As these winds proceed to the east, they get depleted of rain. The eastern regions of the Western Ghats are called rain-shadow regions. The Bay of Bengal monsoon winds bring rain to Myanmar, Bangladesh, North-East Indian regions, foothills of the Himalaya and the North-Indian plains. The rain reduces as we move from North east to North west. With the exception of the TamilNadu region, most of the country’s regions receive rain during the South-West Monsoon. Retreating Monsoons : By the end of October, because of the Wide-spread South-West Monsoon rains, there is a decrease in the temperature. Besides, during this season, the sun rays fall Vertically on the Southern hemisphere. As a result, there is a drop in the temperature in the Northern hemisphere. Hence this area becomes an area of high presure and the South-West monsoon winds start receding. Slowly, they stop blowing by the end of November. This is called the Activity : Collect the information from the newspapers about the temperature in the major cities. Discuss with teacher about varition in temperature. Receding Monsoon Period. During this season. India receives about 13% of the annual rainfall. Tropical eyclones frequently occur in the Bay of Bengal during this season. They can Widespread damage along their path, particularly along the coast. 4. Winter season : In India, the winter season begins from Decem­ ber and", " February end. During this season Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and the North Indian plains witness very low temperature. In some places, the temperature drops to sub-zero levels and ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 90 heavy snowfall occurs. But in South India, temperature is normal and the climate is very pleasant. India receives just about 2% of the annual rainfall during this season. Hence, the winter season is the season of least rainfall. Distribution of rain: Normally India receives its annual rainfall through the South-West monsoon. There are a lot of variations in the intensity of rainfall. India receives its rainfall during all the seasons. The country’s average rainfall is 118 cms. However, different regions receive rainfall during different seasons. Besides, total rainfall differs from one region to another. Based on the total quantum of rainfall, India can be divided into three regions. 1. Low rainfall region : Areas getting less than 50 cms of rain are called areas of deficit rainfall. Thar desert of Rajasthan and its adjoining areas like Punjab, Haryana, Kutch regions, Jammu and Kashmir, eastern parts of Maharashtra and interior Karnataka are the areas of deficit rainfall. Ruyli of Jaisalmer district in Rajasthan is the area receiving least annual rainfall of 8.3 cms in the country. 2. Moderate rainfall region : Areas getting rain from 50 to 250 cms are called areas of moderate rainfall. All areas other than less and surplus rainfall come under this group. 3. Heavy rainfall region : Areas receiving more than 250 cms of rain are called areas of surplus rainfall. Western areas of Western Ghats, Assam and other eastern states and West Bengal come in this category. Mawsynram region of Meghalaya gets highest rainfall in the country. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 91 Climatic condition of a country has a great Activity : Get to know about the amount of rainfall received in your taluk this year.

India consists of various types of soil. Soil is formed by the weathering of rocks under different types of climate. Some soils are deposited by the agents of denudation. Soil also includes decayed material of plants and animals organic matter. The soil of India can be classified into 6 main types: 1. Alluvial soil 2. Black soil 3. Red soil 4. Laterite soil 5. Desert soil and 6. Mountainous soil. 1. Al", "luvial Soil : The soils in the lower areas is called alluvial soil. Lower areas soils are most extensively spread over vast areas compared to other types of soil. It is deposited over approximately 7.7 million square kilometers. This type of soil are covered in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa, Punjab, Haryana and Brahmaputra valley of Assam. Besides, Narmada and Tapti valley and the coastal plains on both sides of the peninsular plateau also have this kind of soils. The main crops grown on this type of soil are wheat, paddy, sugarcane, cotton and jute. 2. Black Soil : Black soil is also called ‘Regur soil’. It is best suited for cotton cultivation. Therefore is also called ‘Black Cotton soil’. This type of soil is seen in about 5.46 lakh Km. The area of black cotton soil is also called Deccan Trap. The soil is formed from the weathering of igneous rock. It contains more of clay particles. It is fertile and capable of retaining water. This type of soil is seen in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Western areas of Andhra Pradesh and North Karnataka. This soil more of lime and magnesium carbonates. It is highly suitable for dry farming. Cotton, jowar, wheat, onion, chilli, tobacco, oil seeds, lemon and grapes are major crops growing in this soil. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 93 3. Red Soil : Largest area of peninsular Plateau coverd with red soil. It is found in about 5.18 lakh Km2. It can be seen from Kanyakumari in the South to Jhansi in Madhya Pradesh in the north. It spreads from Gujarat’s Kutch area to Raj Mahal hills in the Jharkhand area. The major crops growing in this type of soil are ragi, tobacco and oil seeds. Areas having irrigation facility grow paddy, sugarcane, cotton etc. 4. Laterite Soil : Laterite soil is found normally in the areas receiving more than 200 cms of rainfall. Because of having rainfall, the minerals of the soil get washed off leaving behind ferric oxide and aluminium in the surface soil. Hence th", "is soil also looks red in colour. The minerals dissolved in the rainwater percolate to deeper layer of the soil and insoluble oxides of iron and aluminium are found in the top layers. Laterite soil is less fertile and lack nitrogen and minerals. In India this type of soil is found in about 2.48 lakh km, extending over the Western Ghats, the Vindhyas, the Satpuras, the Rajmahal hills and Poorvachal region. It is suitable for the cultivation of coffee and tea and other plantation crops. 5. Desert Soil : Desert soil are formed in the regions of less rainfall and high temperature. It is red and brown colour. Water percolates easily without retentive and moisture gets reduced in the soil. About 1.4 lakh km of this kind of soil is found in India. Jowar, Sajje and dates are grown in this soil. It is distributed in the areas of north-west Rajasthan and adjoining areas of Punjab, Haryana, Kutch area of Western Gujarat and the Western parts of the Aravalli mountains. 6. Mountain Soil : It contain plenty of decayed organic matter. This soil is found on the lower slopes of the mountains. It is very rich in nitrogen ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 94 and organic residues. It is suitable for the growth of coffee, tea, spices and fruits. Foothills of the Himalayas, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and other mountainous regions have this type of soil. Soil Erosion Transportation of surface soil by various natural forces is called soil erosion. Running water, winds and sea waves are the main causes of soil erosion. Causes of Soil Erosion: Soil erosion is one of the most important problems of our country. There is an increase in soil erosion in the recent years. The important causes are 1.Deforestation 2. Over grazing 3.Unscientific methods of cultivation. 4. Over irrigation etc. Even manufacture of bricks, tiles and pots use the top layer of the soil leaving behind depleted soil. Effects of soil erosion: Soil erosion leads to many", " problems. Most important of them are: 1) Soil erosion leads to accumulation of silt in the river beds, thereby causing floods. 2) With accumulation of silt in river course changing direction of rivers course. 3) Due to accumulation of silt, the storage capacity of the reservoirs get reduced. 4) Due to soil erosion, the volume of water percolating down gets reduced. Due to this, natural springs dry up. As India is mainly dependent on agriculture, its productivity is reduced. Hence, to preserve fertility and productivity, prevention of soil erosion is essential. Conservation of Soil and Management: Prevention of soil erosion and protecting the fertility of the soil is known as Conservation of Soil. In addition to this, protecting the fertility of the soil and using the soil in a healthy way for increasing the agricultural produce is its management. The five-year plans have given a lot of importance to this aspect. There are many ways of preventing soil erosion: ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 95 i. counter ploughing. ii. constructrion of bunds arround the agriculture land. iii. development of terraced agricultural fields. iv. prevention of deforestation and encouragement of afforestation. v. control of livestock grazing. vi. planned use of water. vii. construction of check dams etc. Do you know this? • Soil is one of the most important natural resources. It is an important national wealth. • Soil made up of very fine particles is called clay soil. • Sandy soil is made up of large particles. • Pedology is the study of formation of soil, structure, chemical composition and its changes.

This is influenced by various ecological factors like temperature, rain, land forms, soil etc. According to a survey of 2009, India has approximately 6.9 lakh km2 (i.e. 69 million hectares) of forest forming an average of 21.2% of the geographical area. India is a vast country having various types of natural environment and based on the natural vegetation they can be divided into 6 main types: 1. Evergreen forests 2. Deciduous monsoon forests 3. Tropical Grasslands 4. Mangrove forests 5. Desert vegetation and 6. Alpine forests of Himalayas. 1. Evergreen forests: In India, ever", "green forests are found in regions which are not more than 900 mts above sea level and receive an annual rainfall of more than 250 cms. This type of forests are found in Western Ghats, North Eastern states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur, Nagaland and Andaman-Nicobar islands. Evergreen forests occupy about 2.6 lakh hectares. Since the trees are always green they are called Evergreen forests. 2. Deciduous monsoon forests : This type of forests are more widely distributed in India. They are seen in areas receiving 75 to 250 cms of rainfall. It forms about 65.5% of the total area of forests. Since India has mainly monsoon climate, this type of forest is distributed widely. The trees shed their leaves during the dry winters. As such these are also called deciduous monsoon forests. 3. Tropical Grassland : This type of vegetation are found in the areas receiving 60 to 75 cms of rain fall. These areas have tall grass and small herbs are rarely seen here and there. Central parts of the peninsular ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 98 Plateau, border areas of Thar desert to the west of Aravalli hills have this type of vegetation. Babool, Seesum and Sabhai type of grass are seen in these areas. 4. Mangrove forests : These forest are formed due to tides. The Mangrove forests are found along the deltas and coastal regions and estuaries of rivers, that are subjected tides. River delta of the Ganga, Mahanadi, Godavari and Krishna have this kind of forests. The ‘Sundari’ trees are plenty in the Ganga basin and hence these forests are called ‘Sunderbans’. The total area of these forests is about 4.4 thousand km. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 99 5. Desert forests : This type of vegetation is found in regions receiving less than 50 cms of rain. The Thar desert in Rajasthan and its adjoining areas in Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat have these forests. The plants are deep-rooted and consists mainly of thorny shrubs. 6. Alpine forests of ", "Himalayas : Different types forests are found in the Himalayas. As the height increases, the tropical type of climate changes into the polar type of climate. According to the changes in climate, various types of plants are found. The important types of trees growing in this type of forest are sal, byra, toon, silver spruce, laurel etc. These trees have pointed leaves. DISTRIBUTION OF FORESTS : Scientists opinion that, for any area to possess a good environment, it should have 33% of its land area under forests. When the forest area is compared to the total area of the country are very less. India has very lesser area of forests. Madhya Pradesh has largest area under forests whereas Haryana is in the last position which has the area under forests. Karnataka state is in the 13th position in terms of area of forests. Conservation of Forests : Protection of forests from human beings, animals and natural disasters are called Conservation of forests. Indian forests areas are gradually decreasing, because of expansion of agriculture, animal-grazing, construction of roads and rail routes, irrigation projects, forest fires, mining forest fires etc., are the main causes for the destruction of forests. Hence it is very essential to protect forests. Certain measures have to be taken towards this purpose. Methods of Conservation : Cutting down dried-up and abrasing trees which causes forest fires; Protecting the forest trees against diseases; planting saplings; sowing seeds; guarding against illegal cutting of trees; avoiding grazing of domestic animals in forests; motivating people to plant saplings; creating awareness among people about trees and encouraging them to protect them; implementing the social forestry projects speedily and successfully. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 100 Wild-life Sanctuaries: Wild-life sanctuaries have been set up to protect animals in their natural habitat.

It is one of the basic requirements of human beings and it is a national property. This is being used for irrigation, hydro-electric power generation, industry, domestic use, transportation, fisheries and also for recreational purposes. The development of water resources has become very essential to satisty the needs of growing population. As a natural resource, its judicious conservation is required. The water resources on the surface of the earth are the rivers and lakes. Wells and springs are ground water resources. The availability of water varies from region to region and time to time. Rainfall in India is uncertain, unreliable, unequally distributed. Agriculture depends on canals, tanks, well irrigation projects. Irrigation means supply of water to agriculture Do you know this? • The total volume of river water in India is 1869 billion cubic kilometers. Of this, usable water is only 690 million cubic kilometers. • Available Ground water is 432 million cubic kms. • The total available water volume is thus estimated at 1122 billion cubic kms. • 1 Hectare = 2.47 Acre. from canals, wells and tanks artificially or manually. Irrigation is very essential in the regions of low rainfall. Irrig", "ation is the most important development in the history of agriculture. With the available water for irrigation in India, a maximum of 140 million hectares can be irrigated. Upto 2006, the net irrigated area is only 62.2 million hectares. At present India has the largest area under irrigation in the world. Types of Irrigation: India being known for a variety of physical features, we can see the variation in the distribution of water resource ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 103 too. Besides, based on the water requirement for Do you know this? India has the largest area under irrigation in the world and China ranks second. agriculture, distribution of rainfall, physical features, types of crops and the types of agricultural methods used, various types of irrigation are in use in different places. Based on the source of irrigation, these can be divided into : 1. Well irrigation 2. Canal irrigation and 3.Tank irrigation. 1. Well irrigation: Well irrigation is the most important types of irrigation in India. It provides water to large areas of agricultural land. Supplying ground water by digging or drilling wells is called well irrigation. Well irrigation is more useful in low rainfall regions. Construction and maintenance of wells is easier. Well irrigation becomes essential where the canals and tanks are not available. There are two types of wells: 1.Open wells 2.Borewells. Open wells : This type of wells are dug up in suitable agricultural land. Water is lifted from openwells through manual power or with the help of diesel or electric pump set. Tube wells : Today in India’s well irrigation system, role of borewells are very important. 59.7% of total well irrigation area and 33.7% of the total irrigated area comes under tubewell irrigation. 2. Canal Irrigation : Canal irrigation are very Do you know this? Cusecs : This word refers to the water that flows per cubic feet per second. important system of irrigation in India. India is one of the impo", "rtant country in the world using canal irrigation. Vast areas of cultivable land can be irrigated by this method. India about 16.5 million hectares are under canal irrigation. This is the second most important irrigation type after well irrigation. There are two types of canals. a. Flood canals b. Perennial canals directly a. Flood canals: Water is drawn directly from the river through canals without the help of any dams. When the river level is high the excess water passes through the canals. These are called flood canals. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 104 b. Perennial canals: Dams are constructed across the rivers and water is stored in the reservoirs. This water is provided for agriculture through canals, which are called Perennial canals. This type of canal networks can be seen in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Bihar. 3. Tank irrigation: It is practice in India since ancient times. Small bunds are constructed accross streams. Water is stored and supplied to cultivable areas through small canals or pipes. Tank irrigation is common in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Karnataka. In addition, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh also have tank irrigation. MULTI-PURPOSE RIVER VALLEY PROJECTS India has undertaken the construction of many river valley projects for the manimum citilisation of rever water resources. These projects have other purposes besides providing water for agricultural use. Such projects are called multi-purpose river valley projects. The main aims of these projects are: 1. providing irrigation facility; 2. production of hydro-electric power; 3. prevention of floods; 4. creating facility for water transportation; 5. providing water for domestic and industrial use; 6. preventing soil erosion; 7. developing fisheries; 8. enhancing forest wealth. IMPORTANT MULTI-PURPOSE RIVER VALLEY PROJECTS OF INDIA 1. Damodar River Valley Project: This is th", "e first multi-purpose river valley project of independent India. This project is the joint venture between the states of West Bengal and Bihar. This river was causing large scale destruction to life and property in West Bengal and, as such, it was called ‘Sorrow of Bengal’. To prevent destructions by the river, this project was taken up. This project has a total canal network of 2495 kms and supplies water for 4.5 lakh hectares of land. Dams have been constructed across Damodar river and its tributaries at Tilaiyya, Maithan, Konar and Panchet hill. Thermal power stations have been established at Bokaro, Chandrapur and Durgapur. West Bengal and Jharkhand have been benefitted from this project. 2. Bhakranangal Project: It is the highest multi-purpose valley projects of India. This is the joint venture between Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 105 state. Dams are constructed at Bhakra and Nangal of Himachal Pradesh across rthe Sutlej river. The dam at Bhakra is the higest (226 mts) in project has a canal network of about 3402 kms and provides irrigation to 14.6 lakh hectares. Delhi and Himachal Pradesh have benefitted from this project by way of getting irrigation and hydro-electric power. The reservoir created by this dam is called ‘Govindasagar’. 3. Kosi Project: The main objective of this project was to prevent floods. Kosi was called ‘Sorrow of Bihar’. This is a joint project between India and Nepal. A dam is built across Kosi river at Hanumanagar on the border of India and Nepal. This project provides irrigation facilities 8.75 lakh hectares of land. 50% of the hydro-electric power generated by this project is supplied to Nepal. 4. Hirakud Project: This project is constructed across the Mahanadi, in Orissa about 10 kms from Sambalpur. This river was known as Sorrow of Orissa an account of its frequent floods. Hirakud is the longest dam in the country, measuring 4801 mtrs in length. It provides irrigation facility", " to a total of 2.54 lakh hectares. This project provides irrigation facilities and hydro-electric power to Orissa, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh states. 5. Tungabhadra project : Irrigation and generation of hydroelectric power are the main objectives of this project. It is established jointly by Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh states. This dam is built across Tungabhadra river at Mallapur near Hospet in Bellary district. It provides hydro-electric power and irrigation facility to 5.5 lakh hectares in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The reservoir is called ‘Pampasagara’. 6. Nagarjunasagar Project : This dam is constructed at Nandikonda village of Andhra Pradesh across the river Krishna. Irrigation and generation of hydroelectric power are its main objectives. This provides irrigation facility to a total of 8.30 lakh hectares. 7. Upper Krishna : This is a major project of Karnataka. This project provides irrigation and drinking water to Bijapur, Bagalkot, Raichur and Gulbarga districts. It is constructed across the river Krishna near Alamatti of Bijapur district. This has resulted in the formation of Lal Bahadur Shastri reservoir. Another dam is built near Narayanapura. The name of the reservoir is ‘Basavasagara’. Together they provide irrigation facility to ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 106 a total of 6.47 lakh hectares. Recently, hydro-electric power generation has also started. 8. Narmada Valley Project: Narmada Project Authority was established since this project is entangled with many controversies right from its inception. The dam is constructed between Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and a decision was arrived at by the NPA on the distribution of water. Narmada river has totally 23 dams across its length and Sardar Sarovar, Narmada Sagar and Narmada Upper Projects are the main ones. This project provides irrigation facility and hydro-electric power to North Gujarat, Rajasthan and a few areas of Maharashtra state. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS No", "t to be republished 107 INDIA’S MAJOR HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS Hydro-electric power is the second important source of power in India. Hydro-electric power is generated to an extent of 13.9% of the total power generated in 2011. It is estimated that India has a potential to generate 410 billion kw of hydro-electric power. But presently only 106.68 billion kw power is being generated. The following states have important hydro- electric power generation centres. 1. Karnataka: Shivanasamudra, Tungabhadra, Jog, Bhadra, Alamatti, Kali (Supa Dam). 2. Andhra Pradesh: Nagarjunasagar, Srisailam project, Ramapadasagar Project, Sileru project. 3. Tamil Nadu: Mettur project, Paikara eletric project, Periyar project, Kundha project, Moyar project, Kodayar project etc. 4. Madhya Pradesh: Banasagar, Gandhisagar, Panchyojana. 5. Maharashtra: Tata hydro-electric power project, Beera project, Vaitarana project, Koyna project. 6. Orissa : Hirakud project, Kolaja project, Rangali project, Naraja project. 7. Bihar : Kosi project, Suvarnarekha project, Tawa project. 8. Gujarat : Kakrapara project, Kadana project, Ukai project. In addition to the above, many other National Power Grid projects are found. National Power Grid: India generates power from various sources. All the states do not have sufficient electric power supply at all times. Hence, to supply power from surplus states to deficit states, a National Power Grid is established. With its help, excess power from any state can be supplied to any other power deficit state. Rain Water Harvesting: Water is very precious. Although India has vast water resource, it is most unevenly distributed. Rainfall is coufined to the rainy season. Even in areas of heavy rainfall, water shortage is seen during the summers. The only solution to the drought condition prevailing in India is ‘Rain Water Harvesting’. Collection of rain water is called “Rain Water Harvesting”. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 108 There are two t", "ypes of water Harvesting : 1.Collection of water at the place of rainfall. eg.roof tops of houses and buildings 2.Collection of flowing rainwater eg. building bunds and collecting water. • Using the water collected from roof tops reduces the dependence on the public water supply. • Digging ponds in agricultural areas and collecting water. • Building check dams to prevent the flow of water and allowing it to percolate to increase of the ground water table. This is called recharging. • Not only individuals, even communities can engage themselves in constructing bunds or digging small ponds to collect the rain water. In Karnataka, conservation of rainwater has been in practice from ancient times. Tanks, lakes and ponds are all methods of conserving water. Failure to pay attention to these trasitional methods has resulted in drought condition and water scarcity. By protecting and managing properly the water problem in the country can be reduced.

The main objective of the economic system is human welfare. The government works towards improvement of human welfare. The important issue arises are: Should the government interfere in man’s economic activities? What is the role of the government in economic development? Till the end of the 19th century, it was the opinion of many economists that the government should not interfere in man’s economic activities. At that time, the governments involved only in the fundamental duties of national security, dispensing of justice and maintenance of law and order. However, with the rise of ‘Welfare States’ in the 20th century, the scope of governments’ involvement got extended. They came forward to provide many facilities like food, clothing, shelter, education, health, hygiene, transport, communication etc. to the citizens. As the Government began involving itself in the economic activities of the people. It began to gain more importance in the process of economic development. Generally, in developing countries, many problems arise due to unemployment, poverty, agricultural backwardness, unequal distribution of income and wealth. Government mediation becomes inevitable in solving such problems. Developing countries also lack basic amenities like transport, communication, electricity, education, health etc. Their government strive towards alleviating these problems. ", "An economic system is characterized by fluctucations in the national income, production, employment, investment, price etc. Such changes are ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 111 called economic fluctuations. When an economy moves towards progress without extreme fluctuations, it is said to have economic stability. Similarly, the income and wealth generated in the country should be distributed as equally as possible to everybody without any discrimination in the name of caste, class, literate or illiterate, urban or rural. This is called social justice. A government’s responsibility is huge since it has to balance economic stability and social justice with economic development. In the 20th century, governments implemented economic plans to achieve faster economic development. In 1929 Soviet Russia implemented the economic plan and emerged successful in achieving quick economic progress. After World War II, governments of many countries resorted to economic planning in order to resolve their economic problems. 1. PLANNING IN INDIA Planning is essential in everyone’s life. If one has to achieve success in one’s personal life, the resources have to be utilized in a planned manner, isn’t that so? If a student desires to acquire knowledge and secure good marks in examinations, student has to utilize their time in the day in a systematic manner. Everyday the number of hours devoted for the study, play, sleep and routine works has to be planned and implemented. Similary, a country also plans to utilize its resources systematically in selected fields to achieve progress within a fixed time period. ‘The conscious and wise process through which Sir M.Visveswariah the government, with certain specific objectives, utilizes the country’s resources in a profitable manner in order to secure maximum satisfaction of its people is called planning’. In order to attain the people’s welfare Government keeping the available resources in mind, on a priority basis, ta", "kes various decisions relating to what should be produced? How much should be produced? and How the product should be distributed? In this way, economic planning becomes a strategy to achieve overall development of the country. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 112 Modern planning was first conceived in India by Bharat Ratna Sir M.Visveswariah. In 1934, he published a book titled ‘Planned Economy for India’ in which he stressed the need for planning to achieve economic development in India. Hence, he is regarded as ‘Father of Economic Planning in India’. After Independence, the Indian Government formed the National Planning Commission in 1950. The Prime Minister is its Chairman. The main objective of the commission is to precisely estimate the natural and human resources and capital in the country, and to prepare plans for effective utilization of these resources. Since the plan period in India is five years, it is called as five-year plan. In 1952 the ‘National Development Council’ was established. The chief ministers of all the states are members of this board. It approves the draft copy of the five-year plans prepared by the National Planning Commission. It also attempts for balanced regional development of all the states in India. 2.

Till now, eleven five-year plans have been implemented. At present, the 12th five-year plan is being implemented from 1 April 2012, and it will be completed on 31 March 2017. The succesive plans has more investment outlays than the previous five year plans. The government has implemented ea", "ch five-year plans with certain specific objectives. These objectives set the goals of the respective plans. Poverty is one of the major problem in Indian economic system. Hence ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 113 eradication of poverty and improving the standard of living is one of the primary objective of Indias fire year plans. In order to achieve this goal, many other objectives has to be attained as they are complimentary and contribute to eradication of poverty and improving the standard of living. They are : 1. Increasing the production to the maximum extent possible. 2. Increasing the employment opportunities. 3. Reducing the economic disparities. 4. Ensuring economic stability. 5. Modernising the economy etc. Achievements of the Five-year plans : Sixty years have passed since five- year plans were introduced in India. Eleventh five years plans have been implemented. What are the success and failure of these five year plans? First let us look at the growth of Activity: Study the bar graph given above and answer the following questions: 1. Which is the sector that has contributed most to the national income in 1950-51? 2. In the same year, which sector contributed the least? 3. In 2011-12, which sector has contributed the maximum income? 4. In 2011-12, what is the contribution of the agricultural sector? national income. In the initial 20-year period of planning, our national income grew at an average rate of 3.5% per annum, whereas in the next 20-year period, it grew at an average rate of 5%. During the period from 1991 - 2000, the annual growth was 5.6% whereas during 2001 - 2010, the growth was 7.3%. This means that, over the years, the rate of growth of the national income has increased gradually. In the period between 2001-2010, per capita income has grown at an average rate of 5.6 per annum. In the development of the national income, there is contribution of all the three sectors of the economy, i.e., ©KTBS Not to be republished ", "©KTBS Not to be republished 114 agriculture, industry and services. In the initial period of the plan, the agricultural sector contributed more than 50% to the national income. However, the contribution of this sector has reduced drastically now as 12%. At present, the major contribution to the national income has been from the service sector at 59%. Self-sufficiency has been achieved in the production of food grains. The production has increased five times during the plan period, and reached 257.4 million tonnes in 2011-12. Employment opportunities have increased with the expansion of industry and service sector. Attempts have been made to provide employment opportunities to the rural poor through poverty alleviation and employment-generation programmes. The number of jobs created in the period 2007-12: 5.3 crores - = The number of unemployed at the end of 2012 = 3.1 crores Job Aspirants during 2007-12: 8.4 crores Immense progress has been recorded in the fields of science and technology. Modern technology is being used in the agricultural, industrial and service sectors. Services of our engineers are being exported to foreign countries. The exports of manufacturing and engineering products have increased to a great extent. But unfortunately during the post economic reform period, there is drastic increase in inequality of income as many disadvantaged sections are left out of the growth process. Hence in order to include everyone in the process of growth. Inclusive growth has become the priority of 11th and 12th five year plans. Lot of improvement can be seen with respect to other parameters of development. Life expectancy and literacy rate of people have improved. Rate of infant mortality and post-natal mortality has reduced. Birth and death rates have reduced, and rate of population growth is also decreasing. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 115 The five years plans failed to creat adequate jobs to all the job aspirants in the country. Pove", "rty though relatively has reduced is still at large, disparity between rich and poor is increasing. Equality and social justice is yet to be attained. Lack of basic amenties has deepened. 3. GREEN REVOLUTION The greatest achievement of the five-year plans has been the ‘Green Revolution’. ‘Revolution’ means ‘quick change or progress’. The foodgrain production in India during 1967 was 74 million tonnes. Due to the initiatives of the government it increased to 108 million tonnes in 1970. The drastic increase in foodgrain production during the period is called as Green Revolution. The Green Revolution was the consequence of using ‘high yielding seeds’. In the beginning of 1960, Dr.Norman Borlaug a German agricultural scientist conducted many experiments in Mexico, the result of which was the discovery of high-yielding wheat grains. Mexico and Taiwan made use of this grain and achieved immense success in the production of wheat. Agricultural production dropped drastically in India Dr. M.S. Swaminathan in the year 1965-66 due to severe drought. There was a grave scarcity of foodgrains. To resolve this problem, in 1966, the Indian government initiated the usage of high-yielding variety seeds of wheat in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh. Growing crops using high-yielding grains involves providing specific nutrients, regulated supply of water and protection from diseases. Hence, the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and irrigation facilities was also initiated with the usage of high yielding variety seeds. Irrigation facilities were expanded. As a result, production of wheat increased immensely. This improved technology used in agricultural production is called ‘Pre-harvest Technology’. The role of Dr. M.S.Swaminathan, agricultural scientist in implementing the improved technology in Indian agriculture is significant. Hence he is called ‘the father of Green Revolution’. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be rep", "ublished 116 In the initial stages of the green revolution, improved technology was used only in wheat crop. Inspired by its success, the government encouraged farmers to use high-yielding grains even in paddy, jowar, ragi, sugarcane and other crops. Attempts were made to use improved technology in growing all crops. In addition, steps were taken to spread the use throughout the country. As a consequence, great progress was achieved in agricultural production. By 1980s, India achieved self-sufficiency in the production of food grains. Preharvest technology was utilised only by Activity : Discuss support price for agricultural products with your teachers and farmers. rich and large cultivators. The poor marginal and small farmers could not utilise the high yield variety seeds, chemical and fertilisers as they could not offered it. Hence government subsidised the fertilisers, equipments etc,. So the poor marginal and small formers can also avail the benefits of improved technology. In addition, it also came forward to provide loans to farmers through banks and co- operative organizations at low interest rates. Due to all these measures, farmers at all levels could make use of improved agricultural processes. As a result, agricultural production increased. With the increase in agricultural production, prices of agricultural products decreased and the farmers could not recover their agriculture expenditure. Ensuring a fair price to the farmers’ products became inevitable. How could a good price be secured for the farmers’ produce? In order to ensure a good price for the farmers’ products agri-markets were improved. Surplus produce had to be processed and used for manufacturing a variety of products. It became necessary to construct granaries and cold-storage warehouses to store the surplus produce. The latest technology had to be implemented for providing all these facilities. The improved technology that is used to procure, process and market agricultural produce is ca", "lled ‘Post-Harvest Technology’. Both pre-harvest and post-harvest technology has enabled the green revolution. ©KTBS Not to be republished ©KTBS Not to be republished 117 Do you know this? Rainbow Revolution In addition to farming, farmers also engage in related activities of cattle-breeding, poultry-farming, fishery and silk farming. The enormous increase in production resulting from agriculture and agro- based activities is called ‘Rainbow Revolution’. This revolution consist many smaller revolutions. They are : 1. Green Revolution - Production of Food Grains 2. Blue Revolution - Production of Fish 3. Yellow Revolution - Production of Oil Seeds 4. White Revolution - Production of Milk 5. Silver Revolution - Production of Eggs 6. Golden Revolution - Production of Fruits and Flowers 7. Red Revolution - Production of Meat In order to solve the problems in agricultural sector efforts are made to promote organic and natural farming in Indian agriculture. The nature friendly techniques of productions is the need of the hour. Government is making its efforts to further increase the agricultural production through this techniques. This process is being referred to as ‘the Second Green Revolution’ or ‘Perpetual Green Revolution’. Some enthusiastic farmers have been implementing eco-friendly and stable agricultural practices like organic farming, zero-investment farming etc. and are already reaping the benefits. NITI Aayog National Institution for Transforming India was started on 1st Jan 2015 to replace planning commission. NITI Aayog uses bottom-up approach.
